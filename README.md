# 📘 Named Entity Recognition and TEI Annotation of Hannah Arendt's Texts
This project applies Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques and XML/TEI annotation to the texts of Hannah Arendt. The goal is to create an annotated and structured corpus useful for research projects in the fields of philosophy and digital humanities.

### 📌 Main objectives
- Extract PERSON entities using spaCy + transformers.
- Annotate the text with semantically coherent XML tags.
- Generate a structured list of mentioned people, inspired by the TEI format.

### ⚠️ Important Notice:
This project is designed to run in Google Colab.
Colab provides a pre-configured Python environment with support for libraries like spaCy, and makes file handling and cloud execution easier—avoiding local setup or compatibility issues.
