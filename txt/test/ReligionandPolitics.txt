Religion and Politics

I

The question whether the present struggle between the Free World and Communism is “at its foundation a religious one” or a “pure power struggle” carefully avoids a third alternative: whether it is basically an ideological one. This happens to be my own opinion, and it is obvious that this view has more in common with the theory of a religious struggle than with the one that sees in it only a variation of the old game of power politics. The following considerations concern themselves, therefore, mainly with what this apparently merely semantic difference means, or whether the substitution of the word “religion” for the word “ideology” is justified.
  If we use the term ideology, it first looks as though, as in the case of a basically religious struggle, two ways of interpretation are open: either the struggle is between two different ideological systems, or it is between ideology and freedom. A struggle between two ideological systems occurred for a brief historical moment when racist Germany attacked Bolshevik Russia, but this can hardly apply to the fight of the Free World; it would ⌈be a contradiction in terms, or it would⌋ render the word “ideology” altogether meaningless, if we were to conceive of an ideology whose leading “idea” was freedom. It is in the nature of the ideological isms that they explain by one “idea” an allegedly necessary historical process, of progress or of doom, and that they demonstrate its necessity by an argument as compulsorily cogent as some purely logical chains of coercive conclusions where everything is deduced from a single premise whose truth is assumed to be self-evident and axiomatic. The absolute consistency in the demonstration of ideological processes corresponds to the alleged necessity with which they take place; this logicality gives the argument a force of inner coercion to which no other thinking can lay claim. Freedom, in other words, is conspicuously absent not only from the allegedly real processes themselves, but also from ideological argumentation. Moreover, neither of the two totalitarian systems we know has ever claimed to be free. Freedom, in their opinion, be it freedom of action or freedom of thought, is a minor and in the long run irrelevant obstacle in the ▸| path of historical necessity; freedom, in the formulation of Lenin bu¿ in the opinion of all totalitarian-minded people, is a prejudice .
  The interpretation of the new political ideologies as political, or secular, or immanentist religions has curiously, and perhaps not accidentally, followed Marx’s well-known denunciation of all religions as mere ideologies. But its true origin is even older. Not Communism, but atheism was the first ism to be denounced or praised as a new religion.1  This sounds like, and originally was meant to be, no more than a witty paradox until Dostoevsky and many after him gave it some substance. Atheism then was recognized to be more than the rather stupid claim to know and be able to prove the non-existence of God; it was taken to mean an actual rebellion of modern man against God Himself. In Nietzsche’s words: “If there were a God, how could I bear not to be one.”
  Among the isms, atheism can claim to be a special case; the justification for calling it a religion, which applies to no other ideology, is closely connected with modern religious beliefs themselves, as they have grown up and become authoritative in an era of secularity. Ever since the rise of the natural sciences in the 17th century, belief no less than non-belief had its source in doubt; Kierkegaard’s famous theory of the leap into belief had its predecessor in Pascal, in that both replied to Descartes’: De omnibus dubitandum est.2  They hold that universal doubt, existentially, is an impossible, self-contradictory and self-destroying attitude, unfit for human reason because the doubt itself is subject to doubt. Doubt, as Kierkegaard says, “is not defeated through the system (sc. of all attainable knowledge H.A.), but through belief, just as belief has brought doubt into the world.”3  Modern belief, which has leaped from doubt into belief, and modern atheism, which has leaped from doubt into non-belief, have this in common: both are grounded in modern spiritual secularism and have decided its inherent perplexities by a violent resolution once and for all. As far as religion is concerned, it may be that the leap into belief has done more to undermine its unquestioned authority than the usually trite arguments of professional enlighteners or the vulgar arguments of professional atheists. The leap from doubt into belief could not but carry doubt into belief, so that from then on religious life it▸|self began to assume the curious tension between atheistic blasphemous doubt and belief, as we see it in the great psychological masterpieces of Dostoevsky.
   Spiritually our world is a secular world because it is a world of doubt. If we wanted to eliminate doubt in true earnest, we would have to eliminate modern science and its transformation of the world. Modern science is based on a philosophy of doubt, as distinguished from ancient science which was based on a philosophy of θαυμάζειν, of wonder at that which is as it is. Instead of marvelling at the miracles of the universe which revealed themselves in their appearance to human senses and reason, we began to suspect that things might not be what they seemed to be. Only when we began to distrust our sense perceptions, could we make the discovery that contrary to all daily experience the the earth revolves around the sun. From this basic distrust of appearances, this doubt that appearance itself reveals truth, two radically different conclusions could be drawn: Pascal’s despair that “les sens abusent la raison par de fausses apparences”4  from which comes the “recognition of human misery without God,”5  or the modern scientific pragmatic affirmation that I can know only what I make, and that truth itself is by no means a revelation but rather a process of ever-changing patterns of working hypotheses. (Because our traditional religion is essentially a revealed religion and holds, in harmony with ancient philosophy, that true is what reveals itself, that truth is revelation, modern science has become a so much more formidable enemy of it than ancient philosophy ever could be. This radically different understanding of truth is even more decisive than the opposition of transcendence versus immanence.) Against this scientific optimis which, though it is no longer frankly atheistic, still must assume that the question of the existence of God is irrelevant to the (admittedly limited) possibilities of human knowledge, stands the modern religious insight that no process of doubting and no working hypotheses will ever give satisfactory answers to the riddle of the universe and the more disturbing riddle of man himself. But this insight is nourished by the same thirst for knowledge and the fundamental loss of faith in the truth-revealing capacity of appearance itself that lies at the ba▸|sis of our whole world.
  The religious character of such doubt is indicated in the accompanying suspicion that an evil spirit, and not divine Providence, set limits to human thirst for knowledge, that a higher being willfully may deceive us.6  And this suspicion could rise only out of a thirst for security of knowledge so passionate7  that it made its holder forget that human freedom of thought and action is possible only under conditions of limited knowledge.
  Modern religious belief is the “belief to know” of those who doubt that knowledge is possible at all. As such, it is distinguished from pure faith, whose existence or non-existence in the modern world has little to do with its fundamentally secular character. But it is noteworthy that ⌈the same great writer⌋ Dostoev. who presented to us in so many figures the modern religious tension between belief and doubt, could show a figure of true faith only in the character of an “Idiot”. Modern religious man belongs in the same secular world as his atheistic opponent precisely because he is no “idiot” in it. The modern believer who cannot bear the tension between doubt and belief will immediately lose the integrity and the profundity of his belief. The justification of the apparent paradox of calling atheism a religion, in brief, comes from the mental familiarity of the greatest of modern religious thinkers—Pascal, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky—with atheistic experience.
  Our question, however, is not whether in calling Communism a religion we can call believers and non-believers by the same name, but whether the Communist ideology still belongs in the same category and the same tradition of doubt and secularism that gave this nominal identification a more than formalistic plausibility. Communism as an ideology is not identical with atheism. The atheism of non-believers can hardly be called an ideology, because they do not pretend to explain the course of all events with its “idea,” the non-existence of God. Atheism as an ideology is a rather weak and non-consequential attempt to counter the ideology of deism, for which God has ceased to be a living God, the Creator of the world, and has become an all-explaining “idea,” a mental category usually needed for the explanation of history as progress. Communism pretends to have found the law of ▸| historical movement, but does not ascribe to it “what believers of traditional religions ascribe to God.”8  Only deists, ideologists themselves, may have done this, while traditional religion, for which God is no idea with which to explain the course of the world, cannot possibly ascribe to God “social development.” If believers ascribe to God social development, they can no longer be counted among the adherents of traditional religion; they have become ideologists themselves who transform the religious concept of a Divine Providence, whose ways are inscrutible to man, into a demonstrable course of human progress. In other words, even if Communism were primarily atheistic, it would not be a counter-religion (as long as we understand a religion in traditional historical terms and do not assume that everything that cannot be proved scientifically is for this reason alone “religious”), but the opposite of the deistic ideology.
  Communism, though it is in a way atheistic, is not the same as atheism. It never even tries to answer specifically religious questions and the negation of a transcendent God is a marginal feature of it. It is an error to think that an ideology raises the same questions or gives the same kind of explanations to its adherents as theology gives to believers in a religion. Every theology treats man as an animal rationale who asks questions and whose reason needs reconciliation even if he is expected to believe in that which is beyond reason. An ideology, and Communism more than any other, treats man as though he were a falling stone, endowed with the gift of consciousness and therefore capable of observing, while he is falling, Newton’s laws of gravitation. To call Communism a religion implies on the one hand an entirely undeserved compliment, which is dangerous because in the secular world where we actually live all religions are supposed to enjoy equal rights and to tolerate each other. On the other hand, it implies an overestimation of the role of atheism in Communism, ⌈an overestimation⌋ which is due to our earlier experiences with the still familiar phenomenon of atheism, but which, like all such interpretations which model the unprecedented from well-known precedents, easily tempts us to overlook the veritable abyss which seperates the Free World from the totalitarian part of the globe.
  Until very recently, this whole matter was not much more than a ▸| dispute in terminology, and the use of the word “political religion” for avowedly anti-religious, political movements not much more than a figure of speech.9  Certain liberal sympathizers, precisely because they did not understand what was going on in the Russian “great new experiement” were especially fond of the term. Somewhat later, it was used by disappointed socialists who thought that Stalin’s deification of Lenin’s corpse or the allegedly “medieval scholastic” methods of Marxist argumentation were the reason for the backfiring of the Russian Revolution. Only during the last few years has the term “political or secular religion” acquired a scholarly standing.
  Among the scholars, two quite distinct trends of thought and approach should be noticed, ⌈although in many published works they run into each other:⌋ the historical approach, for which a “secular religion” is quite literally a religion growing out of the secularity of our present world and for which Communism is  only the most radical version of its immanentist heresy; and the approach of the social sciences which think that Communism for its adherents fulfills a “religious function”, essentially the same function as our religious denominations fulfill in a free society.
 


II

The great advantage of the historical interpretation of Communism as a secular religion is that it recognizes that totalitarian domination and its ideologies are not merely deplorable accidents but have grown out of Western history, and  From this it is concluded that the key to their understanding and defeat can only be found in Western tradition itself: The most spectacular spiritual event of the modern age is the secularization of the world, and its outstanding characteristic is the abandonment of transcendence as the source of all values, its immanentist creed. The abandonment of transcendence, since it was the source of all “values”, has either deprived our life of all meaning or transformed values, which originally were meant to be only the transcendent measurements of earthly events and behavior, into tangible, attainable goals. (Marx’s classless society always serves as the most convenient example and is understood as the secularization of the Messianic Age or of Paradise.) This transformation is seen as the hubris of modern man who has arrogated to himself the power of God. Hubris, however, does not spring from a Nietschean ▸| rebellion against God; it is the result of an inevitable process which begins when man loses sight of the transcendent source of his “values” and the transcendent meaning of his earthly destiny. Communism, consequently, is not simply anti-religious, but is the specific perversion, the precisely fitting heretical aberration from orthodox creed. The secular world, if it persists in its secularity, is doomed (the most eminent representative of this theory of secularism, Eric Voegelin, does not hesitate to speak of the “putrefaction” of the West10  ); it will end in some such immanentist predicament of which Communism is only the most radical expression. Secular or political religions, in other words, are only the radicalization of the specifically secular, immanentist elements of modernity. The struggle of the Free World against Communism, therefore, can be successful only to the degree that the Free World opposes its true religious system, its “orthodoxy”, to the immanentist secular heresy of its enemies.
  The merit of this interpretation lies in that it discusses the totalitarian predicament openly in terms of self-interpretation and self-criticism. Its shortcomings, as I see it, lie in a double misunderstanding of the secular world itself. ▸ Secularism, first, has a political as well as a spiritual meaning. In a political fight, its political meaning obviously is of greater importance. Politically, secularism means no more than that religious creeds and religious institutions as such have no binding authority and that, conversely, political life has no religious sanction.  Secularism, first, does not mean ⌈that there is less faith today in the world, but only⌋ [more than] that religious creeds and religious institutions as such have no binding authority and that political life has no religious sanction. ⌈(I quite agree with Romano Guardini’s recent statement that secularity of the world, the fact that our daily public existence is without “consciousness of a divine Power”, does not “imply that individuals are becoming increasingly irreligious; but public consciousness is moving increasingly away from religious categories.” However, I ⌈would not follow him to his conclusion that therefore religion where it exists “is retiring to the inner world.”11  ) This, to be sure, brings up the grave question of the source of authority of our traditional “values”, of our laws and customs and standards for judgment, which for so many centuries had been sanctified by religion and a religiously interpreted transcendence. But this admittedly long religious history of authority does not necessarily prove that the concept of authority itself is of a religious, transcendent nature. As far as its historical origin is concerned, I think it much more likely that ▸| authority, as we understand it in close connection with tradition, is of Roman political origin and was monopolized early by the Church when, after the downfall of the Roman Empire, it became its political as well a spiritual heir.⌋ I do not doubt that one of the chief characteristics of our present crisis is the breakdown of all authority and the broken thread of our tradition; but from this, it does not follow that the crisis is primarily religious or has a religious origin. It does not even necessarily imply a crisis of traditional faith, though it has endangered the authority of the Churches insofar as they are, among other things, also public institutions.
  The second misunderstanding is, I think, more obvious and more relevant. The concept of freedom (and this is primarily a struggle between the Free World and Communism) is certainly not of religious origin. Such proof would be necessary to justify an interpretation of the struggle for freedom as basically religious. For it would not be enough to demonstrate, which nobody doubts, that freedom is compatible with our religious system, but that a system, based on freedom, is religious. ⌈And this will indeed be difficult, Luther’s “freedom of Christian Man” notwithstanding. The very fact that we, as far as our public life is concerned, care more about freedom than about anything else, is proof that we do not live publicly in a religious world.⌋
  To say that this struggle is basically religious may very well mean that we want to assert more than freedom. This, however, would be very dangerous, no matter how tolerant the definition of the more-than-freedom would turn out to be; it could very well drag us into a kind of spiritual civil war ⌈in which we would exclude from our common fight everything that is contrary to “religion”.⌋ And since in this, as in all other fields, no binding authority exists to define once and for all what is compatible and what is not, we would be at the mercy of ever-changing interpretations of our “religion”. ⌈where nobody could know who the next victim was going to be.⌋
  Communist regimes, on the other hand liquidate religious institutions and persecute religious convictions together with a great many other social and spiritual bodies of the most divergent attitudes towards religion. In a country ▸| where even the chess clubs had one day to be liquidated and resurrected in bolshevized fashion, because “to play chess for chess’ sake” already constituted a challenge to the official ideology, the persecution of religion cannot very well be ascribed to specifically religious motives. A Trotskyite in the thirties or a Titoist in the forties were certainly in greater danger of life and limb in Soviet dominated territoy than a priest or minister. The evidence we have about persecutions in totalitarian countries does not bear out the frequently heard assertion that religion more than any other free spiritual activity is felt to be in direct competition with the ruling ideology. If, as is sometimes true, religious people are more persecuted than non-believers, it is simply because they are harder to “convince” and feel that more is at stake. To them, it is a fight for their religion; to the Communists, they are as, but not more, dangerous as any other people who insist on free thought.
  Nor does Communism any more resemble a religion in the accepted sense of the word because it pretends to be in the process of building an earthly paradise and actually has established, in the concentration camps, an institution which in all its varieties is startlingly similar to traditional pictures of Hell, Purgatory and the Underworld. This is certainly not enough to qualify it as a religion. Communism, ⌈on the contrary,⌋ carefully avoids being mistaken as a religion. When the Catholic Church recently decided to excommunicate Communists, because of the obvious incompatibility of Communism with Christian doctrine, no corresponding move from the side of Communists was noticed: to be sure, from the Catholic side, this is a religious fight, just as for a philosopher this is a fight for philosophy. For Communism it is nothing of the sort. It is the fight against a world in which all these things—free religion, free philosophy, free art, etc. are possible at all.
 


III

If we take the Free World at its own word, then the present struggle is for freedom against tyranny. If we take the Communist world at its own word, then the struggle is one of historical necessity and unavoidable progress against the doomed, class-ridden civilization which tries vainly but criminally to prevent the true wel ▸| fare of mankind. The argument of power and national interests plays an almost neglible role in either side of presentation. And it seems that both sides have proved that this is not a struggle of power for power’s sake—America by consciously refusing to take advantage of her enormous power potential immediately after the victory of 1945, and the Soviet Union by sacrificing important possibilities to develop and stabilize her own power at that moment for more far reaching ideological goals. (This historically curious absence of power motives in the major struggle of the two great world-powers is, as it were, enhanced by a number of minor local conflicts in which the old, time-honored power motive is still very visible. But the point is that these are all minor conflicts and that the main struggle is no longer primarily a struggle for power.) This, naturally, has been one of the major reasons for calling it a basically religious struggle, since our history provides us only with these two sets of motives. Yet, To any previous time, I think, ⌈this⌋ [our]  refusal to take either side at its own word, this substitution of ulterior (religious) motives of which both sides appear to be quite unconscious as though it were a matter of course that self-interpretation can only lead astray, would have seemed preposterous and, to say the least, quite unscientific. This ⌈most modern and⌋ increasingly important trend in our political evaluations becomes especially pronounced ⌈only⌋ when this struggle is called religious not from the historical considerations we have just discussed, but from the ⌈much more frequent⌋ point of view of the social sciences.
  The father of social sciences methods is Marx. He was the first to look methodically—and not only with the natural awareness that speech can conceal truth as it can reveal it—into self-understanding of history, as we know it from the utterances of great statesmen and, in a larger sense, from the whole of the intellectual and spiritual manifestations of each period. All of which he refused to take at their own word,denouncing them as an “ideological” facades behind which the true historical forces conceal themselves. Later he called all this the “ideological superstructure”; but he started his discovery when he decided not to take seriously “what people say,” but only “the real active human being” whose thoughts are “the ideological reflexes and echoes of ▸| He, therefore, of all materialists was the first to interpret religion as something more than simple superstition or the spiritualization of tangible human experiences ⌈(like Feuerbach),⌋ but as a social phenomenon ⌈in which man “is dominated by the product of his own head as he is dominated in capitalistic production by the product of his own hand.”13  ⌋
  Nowhere in his work is Marx ever genuinely interested in the substance of religious thought, ⌈as Feuerbach, for instance, was when he wrote his Essence of Christianity.⌋ Religion has for him a social function and its essence is identical with this function. ⌈In Marx’s sense one could have called every ideology or every system of thought, no matter what its content, a “religion” if it only fulfilled the same function in society.⌋ To him, a religion without God would not have been an absurdity even though in actual fact Marx with his great knowledge and understanding of history never went quite that far and Engels even protested against those who in his time called atheism a religion by saying that this makes about as much sense as calling chemistry an alchemy without the philosopher’s stone.14   The social sciences today, it is true, have grown away from their origin in Marxism and have become scientific in that they no longer share the Marxist’s prejudice in favor of his own ideology, ⌈as though thought in the interest of the proletariat, by some magic, could suddenly cease to be an “ideological reflex”; they can talk back to Marxists and tell them them that Marxism too is an ideology, no better and no worse than the religions whose ideological character Marx demasked.⌋ By the same token, however, they lost even that amount of awareness for questions and differences of substance (as distinguished from mere functions) which for Marx was still a matter of course. They can therefore call Communism a religion without ever reflecting on its historical background and without ever asking themselves what a religion actually is, and if it is anything at all when it is a religion without God.
  ⌈Moreover, while the non-Marxist heirs of Marxism have grown wise to the ideological character of Marxism and thus, in a way, have become cleverer than Marx himself (to what an extent this whole approach is also a matter of ordinary smartness, Marx himself shows ▸| in a very revealing passage15  ), they are also no longer aware of the philosophical fundament which is still quite apparent in Marx’s own writings and which continues to remain their own because their methods spring from it and make sense only in its categorical framework.⌋
  Marx’s unwillingness to listen to and take seriously “what each period says about itself and imagines it is” derived from his conviction that political action was primarily violence and that violence was the midwife of History.16   This conviction of Marx ⌈is very far from being due to the gratuitous ferocity of a revolutionary temperament or simple evil-mindedness. It⌋ has its place in his general philosophy of history, according to which history, ⌈which has been enacted by men in the mode of false consciousness, i.e. in the mode of ideologies,⌋ can be made by man in full consciousness of what they are doing. ⌈It is precisely this humanist side of Marx’s teachings which led him into his insistence on the violent character of political action; for he saw the making of history in terms of fabrication in general; historical man was to him primarily homo faber.⌋ The fabrication of all man-made things, because it is not creatio ex nihilo, necessarily implies and resides in in some violence done to matter which becomes the underlying material of the fabricated thing. Nobody can make a table without killing a tree. ⌈In this definition and understanding of fabrication, Marx was in complete agreement with the whole tradition of philosophical thought. New was only that he applied these categories to history and thereby to political action.
  Marx, like all serious philosophers since the French Revolution, was confronted with the double riddle that human action, in distinction from fabrication and production, hardly ever achieves precisely what it intended to do because it acts in a framework of “many wills operating in different directions”17   and the fact that the sum of recorded actions, which we call history, nevertheless makes sense, is humanly comprehensible. But he refused to accept the solution of his immediate predecessors who, in the “ruse of nature” (Kant) or the “ruse of reason” (Hegel) had introduced a deus ex machina into human affairs. Instead, he proposed to explain ▸| the riddle by interpreting this whole realm of inexplicable meaning as a “superstructure” over the more elementary productive capacity of man, in which he knows very well what he is doing and is master of his products. The hitherto inexplicable meaningfulness of history, which most certainly is not Kant’s trostloses Ungefähr, was now seen as the reflex of a meaning which was as securely a human product as the technical development of the world, the erection of the human artifice on earth. The whole problem of humanizing political-historical affairs was now how to become master of our actions as we are master of our productive capacity, or, in other words, how to “make” history as we make all other things. Once this is achieved through the victory of the proletariat, we shall no longer need the ideologies, that is the justification of our violence, because this violent element will be in our hands; violence, if it is thus controlled, will be no more dangerous than the killing of a tree for the fabrication of a table. But until that time, all political actions, legal precepts, and spiritual thought conceal the ulterior motives of a society which only pretends to act politically but in fact “makes history”, albeit in an unconscious, i.e. inhuman way.⌋
  Marx’s theory of the ideological superstructure, based as it is on the distinction “between what somebody pretends to be and what he really is,” and the concomitant disregard for the truth-revealing quality of speech, is entirely based on this identification of political action with violence. For violence is indeed the only kind of human action which is mute by definition; it is neither mediated nor operated through words. ⌈In all other kinds of action, political or not, including the action of power politics, we act in speech and our speech is action. (When Achilles was prepared by his educator Phoenix for a short life of supreme action, he was taught to become “a doer of deeds and a speaker of words;”18   the two belong together, as the ancients knew quite well, for whom rhetoric was a political art, an art of action.18a   ) In ordinary political life this close relationship between words and acts is broken only in the violence of war; then, but only then, nothing depends any longer on words and everything on the mute ferocity of arms. War pro▸| paganda, and generally all words spoken during a war, have therefore usually this unpleasant ring of insincerity: here words become “mere talk”, they have no acting capacity any longer, everybody knows that action has left the realm of speech.⌋ The “mere talk” which accompanies and usually follows violence as its justification, is indeed and always has been open to mistrust of being only “ideological”, only a reflex and justification of violence. Here the search for ulterior motives is entirely justified, and historians, ⌈Marx’s statement notwithstanding,⌋ have always [known it.] ⌈shown in these instances at least the same cleverness as “shopkeepers”.⌋
  But only on the assumption that all history is essentially the conflict between classes and can be resolved only by violence, only on the assumption that political action as such is “violent” and conceals its true nature hypocritically, as it were, in all times except during wars and revolutions, have we any right to disregard self-interpretation as irrelevant conscious or unconscious jus­ti­fi­cat­ion of profounder ulterior motives or forces. ⌈The reason why I brought Marx into this discussion is not that I think that the present application of the word “religion” to ideologies is only due to the relativization and then reversal of Marx’s own categories, but rather because I wanted to indicate their general philosophical, and not only scientific, framework.⌋ If we look at the matter from a purely scientific viewpoint, then it seems obvious that one reason for the formalization of social science categories is the scientifically comprehensible desire to Words which accompany violence as propaganda and follow its mute action as justification are indeed the only kind of speech which always has ulterior motives and must always be suspected of being “ideological”—as historians since Thucydides have well known. To suspect all speech of being ideological, to mistrust all self-interpretation as concealing deeper forces rather than revealing them, can be justified only on the assumption that all political action is essentially violent because all history is essentially a conflict between classes, so that only wars and revolutions show historical action in its true, unhypocritical nature.
  But the desubstantialization of the social science concepts has its origin not only in this disregard of all speech and content, but also in the scientifically comprehensible desire to find general rules under which occurrences of all times and different nature can be subsumed. ⌈If we are to trust Engels’ interpretation of Marx (and I think, despite many arguments which have been raised to the contrary, his is the most loyal though sometimes simplified expression of Marx’ own thoughts),⌋ Marx was also the father of the social sciences in this purely scientific sense. He was the first to compare, not mathematics, but the science of nature with the humanities and conceived of a “science of society” ⌈as an all-encompassing discipline, “the sum total of the so-called historical and philosophical sciences”19  ,⌋ which would share and live up to the same scientific standards as natural science. ⌈“We ▸| live not only in nature but also in human society”20   and society therefore should be open to the same methods and rules of investigation as nature.⌋ Reflections on the complementary character of nature and society with relation to human beings were at the basis of the formal and unhistorical categories which from then on began to dominate the historical and social sciences.
  Such categories are not only Marx’s class struggle, ⌈allegedly the law of historical development as Darwin’s law of the survival of the fittest was the law of natural develop­ment21  ,⌋ but more recently Toynbee’s challenge and response or Max Weber’s ideal types. It looks as though the term “political or secular religions” is the latest addition to them ⌈insofar as this term, though originally designed to interpret totalitarian movements, has already universalized itself and is now used to cover a wide range of occurrences, disparate in time as well as in nature.22   (It is noteworthy that this categorization of history bears no resemblance to earlier attempts at formulating general rules which would make the behavior of man more understandable and thereby offer some insight into the working of politics. That men are driven in political action by interest or power thirst are wisdoms as old as history and the political sciences. In contrast to these “subjective” rules, the social sciences today confront us with objective categories which are social in the sense that they do not apply so much to the behavior of individuals, acting under specific historical circumstances, as to the behavior of society, itself enacting history.) 
  Social science owes its origin to the ambition to found a “positive science of history” which could match the positive science of nature.23   Because of this derivative origin, it is only natural that the “positive science of history” should always have remained one step behind natural science which was its great model. Natu⌋ All these terms of the social sciences owe their origin to the ambition to found a “positive science of history which could match the “positive science of nature. Because of this derivative origin it may be only natural that the positive science of history should always have remained one step behind natural science which was it great model. Natural scientists know today what social scientists have not yet discovered, that almost every hypothesis with which they approach nature will somehow work out and yield positive results; so great seems the pliability of observed occurrences that they will always give man the expected answer. It is as though the moment man ▸| puts a question to nature, everything hurries up to re-arrange itself in accordance with his question. I think the day will come when social scientists to their dismay will discover that this is even more true in their own field; there is nothing that cannot be proved and very little that can be disproved: history arranges itself as conveniently and consistently under the category of challenge and response or in accordance with ideal types as it arranged itself under the category of class struggles to Marx’s own satisfaction. There is no reason why it should not show the same obedience when approached with the terminology of secular religions.
  There is, however, one condition to this pliability of historical material, and that is that everything is considered not in its essential nature but only in its function in society, and this consideration in turn is possible only if we refuse to listen to what the sources say themselves, to the content of speech. To take a convenient example, Max Weber coined his ideal type of the “charismatic leader” after the model of Jesus of Nazareth; his followers found no difficulty in applying the same category to Hitler.24   From the viewpoint of the social scientist, Hitler and Jesus were the same, allegedly fulfilled the same social function. It is obvious that such a conclusion is possible only for people who refuse to listen to what either Jesus or Hitler said. ⌈(By taking this example, I do not mean to imply that Max Weber himself would ever have been guilty of this monstrous identification; his great sense of history and respect for historical facts have always prevented his carrying his own methodological instruments and perplexities into absurdity.) Something very similar seems now to happen to the term “religion”.⌋ It is no accident, but the very fundament of the whole trend toward seeing religions everywhere that one of its prominent adherents quotes in a footnote, with approval, the astonishing discovery of one of his colleagues “that God is not only a late arrival in religion; it is not indispensable that he should come.”25   ⌈Here the danger of blasphemy, always inherent in the term “secular religion” shows itself freely, precisely because this is not an accidental remark of some obscure author but poses as result of scien▸|tific research.⌋ If secular religions are possible in the sense that Communism is a “religion without God”, then we no longer live merely in a secular world which has banished religion from its public affairs, but in a world which has eliminated God even from religion—something which Marx and Engels still believed to be impossible.26  
  It is undeniable that this functionalization and desubstantialization of our categories is no isolated phenomenon occuring in some ivory tower of scholarly thought. It is closely connected, of course, with the growing functionalization of our society itself, or rather, with the fact that modern man in true actuality is more and more a mere function of society and, hence, well on his way to becoming a member of what Marx still called enthusiastically a “socialized humanity (gesellschaftliche Menschheit)”27  . The question is only whether scholars, many of whom so ardently and with such excellent reasons have opposed the “socialization of the means of production” should help or hinder the far more dangerous socialization of man.



IV

It is, unfortunately, in the nature of such scientific discussions that the fundamental question underlying all the single quarrels and, perhaps, misunderstandings is all too easily lost sight of. Behind the question of whether this is a religious ⌈or a mere power—i.e. a mere political—⌋ struggle, ⌈and behind the questionable use of the term “secular or political religions”⌋ lies the question of the relationship between religion and politics. If we try to relate this much larger, ⌈and I think, still very obscure⌋ question to our specific problem, and if we take the fact of the present secular world in its primarily political, and not primarily religious or spiritual aspect, then we must ask which is the religious element whose political relevance was so great that its loss had an immediate impact on our political life. ⌈The justification of this question seems to me to lie in the nature of Christianity itself and in the consideration that we did not just lose or preserve or transform a religion, but specifically the Christian⌋ [or to put the same question in another way: which was the speicifically political element in traditional religion?] ▸| ⌈creed.
  Christianity is not only a transcendent religion, it has a very outspoken relation to general secular happenings in this world which can hardly be called political in the sense of public-minded and which still may best be summed up in the words of Tertullian: nobis nulla magis res aliena quam publica —“nothing is more alien to us (Christians) than public affairs.”28   If, as I think, it is true that one of the chief characteristics of our present public life and its perplexities is its very secularity, then the Christian religion ⌈(Tertullian’s, and many other great theologians’, statement notwithstanding)⌋ must have contained a powerful specifically political element whose loss has changed the very character of our public existence. Since the present crisis is admittedly primarily a political one, I think we are justified in asking for the political, as distinguished from the spiritual, significance of secularity.
  A preliminary indication as to where the answer to this question may lie is perhaps given in the unusually brutal and vulgar dictum of a badly frightened king, who in his panic at the revolutionary disturbances of 1848 exclaimed: “The people must not be permitted to lose its religion.” We may, for our purposes, take this statement a little more seriously than it probably was meant and leave out of account the well-known alliance between “throne and altar” which is part of church and of secular politics, but has little to do with the Christian creed. This king also talked about the importance of beliefs in politics, and showed a surprising confidence in the Christian creed for purely secular purposes. This is surprising if we remember that, during the first centuries of its existence, the Christian creed had been considered by Christians and non-Christians to be irrelevant at best and often dangerous and destructive of the public sphere of life. What had happened in the meantime that now, in a time which was almost as secular, it could be called upon for the very preservation of political life? (For this and similar statements on the political aspect of the relation between religion and politics were of course never made during the truly Christian Middle Ages, when ▸| organized religion was a powerful political factor and therefore could not become a mere political instrument. Thus we find them either in the beginning of our era, when Christianity developed in a still completely secular world of public affairs, or in the modern age when public affairs once more have become secular.)⌋
  Marx’s answer, to this question ⌈as brutal as the king’s statement,⌋ is well known: “Religion is the opiate of the people.”29   It is a very unsatisfactory answer, not because it is vulgar, but because it is so unlikely that specifically Christian teachings—⌈their unrelenting stress on the person and his own share in the salvation of his soul,⌋ their insistence on the sinfulness of man and the concomitant elaboration of a catalogue of sins greater than in any other religion, ⌈which certainly has made life more complicated for the ordinary person than ever before⌋—could be used by a true believer ever for anything as luxurious and soul calming as an opiate. Surely, the new political ideologies in terror-ruled totalitarian countries, explaining everything and preparing for anything in an atmosphere of unbearable insecurity, are far more likely and much better fitted to immunize man’s soul against the shocking impact of reality than any traditional religion we know. From the vantage point of totalitarian domination, whose ideological training drugs and stimulates its executionerss as well as its victims, the pious resignation to God’s will, which is usually meant when religion is denounced as an opiate, looks like a child’s pocket-knife compared to atomic weapons.
  There is one powerful element in traditional religion whose usefulness for rule and enforcement is self-evident and whose origin, though doubtful in some respects, is certainly not only, and perhaps not even primarily, of a religious nature. ⌈The medieval doctrine of Hell, its elaborate description, geographical and otherwise, of the place of punishment after death, owes very little to the preaching of Jesus30  , and even required several centuries after Jesus’ death to assert itself at all. It is interesting that this assertion coincided with the downfall of Rome, i.e. the disappearance of an assured secular  order whose authority and responsibility only now became a charge of the Church.31  
▸
  In striking opposition to the scarcity of sources in Hebrew and early Christian writings stands the overpowering influence of Plato’s myth of a Hereafter, with which he concludes so many of his political dialogues, on political thought of antiquity and later on Christian teaching. Between Plato and the secular victory of Christianity which brought with its the religious sanction of the doctrine of Hell (so that from then on this became so general a feature of the Christian world that political treatises did not need to mention it specifically), there is hardly an important discussion of political problems (with the great exception of Aristotle’s work, however) which did not conclude with an imitation of the Platonian myth.32   For it is Plato, and not the strictly Jewish-Christian religious sources, who is the most important forerunner of Dante’s elaborate descriptions; in him we find already the geographical separation of Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, and not merely the concept of final judgment about eternal life or eternal death and the hint at possible punishment after death.33  
  The purely political implications of Plato’s myth in the last book of the Republic, as well as the concluding parts of the Phaidon and the Gorgias, are indisputable. In the Republic, it corresponds to the story of the cave, which is the center of the whole work and which is not a myth but an allegory, destined for the few who are able, without hope or fear to perform the Platonic περιαγωγή, the turning around from the shadowy life of seeming reality to the clear sky of ideas. Life with the ideas, while it clearly alienated them from the life of the polis34  , taught the few true standards of all life, including political affairs, in which, however, they were no longer to be interested for their own sake. Only the fear of being ruled by the multitude could arouse the few to fulfill their political duties.35   These who could understand the story of the cave were not supposed to believe the concluding myth about final reward and punishment. Not only did those who had grasped the truth of the ideas as transcendent standards36   need no more tangible transcendence like an explicit life after death; it would not even have made much sense insofar as the story of the cave already describes life on earth as a kind of Underworld, and this ▸| sense is reinforced by Plato’s use of the words eidôlon and skia which were the key words of Homer’s description of Hades in the Odyssey so that the whole story reads like an exact reply to Homer: not the soul is the shadow and not its life after death the purposeless insustantial motion in the Underworld, but the bodily life of ordinary mortals who do not succed in turning away from the cave of earthly life; our life on earth is life in an Underworld, our body is the shadow and our only reality is the soul. Since the truth of the ideas is self-revealing and therefore self-evident, the true standards for earthly life can never be satisfactorily argued out and demonstrated.37   The multitude which lacks the eye for the invisible measurement of all visible things, needs belief in a stark bodily transcendence in which it does not hold truth itself but only its “myth”.
  Whether or not Plato himself believed in the immortality of the soul, the myth of graduated bodily punishment after death (which since it is bodily even contradicts the theory that only the soul, not the body is immortal)37a    is clearly the invention of a philosophy which deemed public affairs, the affairs in which all are equally involved, secondary and therefore subject to the rule of a truth which is accessible only to a few. The few cannot persuade the multitude of truth because truth cannot become the object of persuasion and persuasion is the only way to deal with the multitude (peithein τὰ πλήθη and rhetoric being the specifically political modes of speech while philosophizing, dialegein, is always carried through in the mode of autos autô, of one person talking to one other38  ). But while the multitude cannot be instructed in the doctrine of truth, it can be persuaded to believe an opinion as though this opinion were the truth. The appropriate opinion which carries the truth of the few to the multitude is the belief in Hell; persuading the citizens of its existence will make them behave as though they knew the truth.
  In other words, the doctrine of Hell in Plato is clearly a political instrument invented for political purposes. This is equally obvious in the concluding myths of the Phaidon and the Gorgias, though we do not have there a corresponding allegory that tells ▸| the philosophical truth like the cave story in the Republic. The Phaidon is not primarily the dialogue on the soul’s immortality, but “a revised Apology more persuasive than the speech (Socrates) made in (his) defence before the judges.”39   And in Gorgias, which in some ways is the first attempt to solve those problems of justice which later were the subject of the Republic, Socrates brings up his myth, still with great diffidence and clearly indicating that he does not take it too seriously, after he has failed to persuade the masters of rhetoric, i.e. of the argument proper for political affairs, and thus has found out that in this realm it cannot be “proved” that it is better to suffer wrong than do wrong.40  
  No doubt, speculations about life after death and descriptions of the Hereafter are as old as the conscious life of man on earth. Still, it may be true that we find in Plato for “the first time in the history of literature that any such legend (sc. of punishment and reward among the dead) has been definitely enlisted in the service of righteousness”,41   i.e. in the service of public, political life. This seems confirmed by the fact that the Platonic myth was so eagerly used by purely secular writers in antiquity, who as clearly as Plato indicated that they did not seriously believe in it, while, on the other hand, the the Christian creed shows no such doctrine of Hell as long as Christianity remained without secular interests and responsibilities. On the contrary, Christian writers during the first centuries almost unanimously believed in a mission of Christ to the Underworld whose main purpose had been to liquidate Hell, to defeat Satan and to liberate the souls of dead sinners, as he had liberated the souls of Christians, from death and punishment.42  
  It looks as though the origin of this doctrine was primarily political and that and it continued to be used for political purposes; that it played no noticeable role in Christianity during the centuries of a purely religious development and received its religious sanction only in the early Middle Ages when political necessity confronted the Church, as it had ancient philosophy, with the old perplexity of enforcing absolute standards⌋▸| And this is the medieval doctrine of Hell which is much older than Christianity and first appears in Plato’s dialogues where it had a purely political function. Throughout antiquity, it continued to be used for political purposes, while even during the first centuries of our era it played no noticeable role in Christianity. Only when in the early Middle Ages political necessities confronted the Church, as it had ancient philosophy since Plato, with the old perplexity of [enforcing] absolute standards ▸| on a realm of life whose very essence seems to be relativity, and this under the eternal human condition where the worst that man can do to man is to kill him, that is to bring about what one day is bound to happen to him anyhow. The “improvement” on this condition proposed in the doctrine of Hell is precisely that punishment can mean more than eternal death, namely eternal suffering ⌈in which the souls yearn for death.43  ⌋ In Plato, it frankly substitutes insight into truth and thus gives human understanding a reliability which it could not possibly have otherwise; in Roman antiquity and in a considerably mellowed form, it is destined to enforce and encourage honorable behavior44  , until finally during the centuries of undisputed Christian authority in religious as well as secular matters, it was apparently taught on the assumption that the stings of conscience were not a too reliable punishment or, for that matter, guide of behavior. ⌈(The development in Christianity itself is clearly indicated in the fourth Lateran Council’s condemnation (in 1215) of the teaching that “hell is not a special place, but that the man who exists in a state of deadly sin finds hell in his own self” and the Church’s rejection of Origin’s opinion that “the fire of hell consisted as much in the stings of conscience as in material torment or the body.”45  )⌋
  If from these premises we look at the modern age, then the outstanding political event in the growing secularization of our o world seems to be that more and more people have lost or are losing the age-old belief in reward and punishment after death while the functioning of individual consciences has remained politically as unreliable as ever. When we look at the totalitarian side of this picture, we see on one hand the almost deliberate attempt to build, in concentration camps and torture cellars, a kind of earthly hell whose chief difference from medieval hell-images lies in technical improvements and bureaucratic administration, but also in its lack of eternity. On the other hand, we have seen in Hitler-Germany that an ideology which also almost consciously (at least in Himmler’s speeches to SS Generals in Eastern Occupied Terri▸|tories) reserved the command Thou Shalt Not Kill into the precept Thou Shalt Kill met no overwhelming resistance from a Western trained conscience, but on the contrary was quite able to make this conscience work the other way round, as though it were nothing but a mechanism to indicate whether or not one is in conforming agreement with society and its beliefs at large.
  The political consequence of the secularization of the modern age, in other words, seems to lie in the elimination from public life, along with religion as such, of the only political element in our traditional creed, the fear of Hell. This loss is politically, though certainly not spiritually, the most significant distinction between our present life and the centuries before us. Insofar as totalitarian ideologies are an interior coercion which compels its subjects as violently as the external compulsion of terror, only the fear of Hell in our own religious system could have hoped to compete with it in power over man’s inner souls. Yet, no matter how religious our world may turn again, or how much authentic faith still exists in it, or how deeply our moral values may be rooted in our religious systems, the fear of Hell is no longer among the motives which would prevent or stimulate the actions of the majority. And this seems inevitable if secularity of the world means separation of the religious and political realms of life; under these circumstances, religion was bound to lose it primarily political elements, just as public life was bound to lose the religious sanction of a transcendent authority. In this separation, which is a fact and, moreover, has its singular advantages for religious as well as irreligious people, there is very little likelihood that religion will be able to help us fight Communism, just as there is very little justification for interpreting this fight as a “basically religious one”.

Engels reports that in Paris in the forties one used to say: “Donc, l’athéisme c’est votre religion”; he thinks because one “could conceive of a man without religion only as a monster.” See: “Feuerbach and the end of Classical German Philosophy.” in: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected Works, London 1950, vol.

Pascal’s negative dependence upon Descartes is too well known to need further documentation.—Johannes Climacus or De Omnibus Dubitandum est belongs to the earliest philosophical manuscripts of Kierkegaard (winter 1842/3); written in the form of a spiritual autobiography, Kierkegaard tells us how this one sentence played a decisive role in his entire life and that he was sorry, after learning from Hegel about Descartes, not to have started his philosophical studies with Descartes. (p.75). Following Hegel’s interpretation of Descartes, he saw in it the quintessence of modern philosophy, its principle and beginning. The little treatise is contained in the Danish edition of Kierkegaard’s Collected Works, vol. IV, Kopenhagen 1909 ff. I used the German translation by Wolfgang Struve, Darmstadt, 1948.

4.
Pensées, 92 (370), ed. by Jacques Chevalier, La Pléiade, Paris 1950. The whole paragraph shows even more clearly how deeply Pascal’s belief was rooted in his despair about the possibilities of secure knowledge: “L’homme n’est qu’un sujet plein d’erreur, naturelle et ineffaçable sans la grâce. Rien ne lui montre la vérité. Tout l’ abuse. Ces deux principes de vérités, la raison et les sens, outre qu’ils manquent chacun de sincérité, s’abusent réciproquement l’un l’autre. Les sens abusent la raison par de fausses apparences; et cette même piperie qu’ils apportent à la raison, ils la reçoivent d’elle à leur tour: elle s’en revanche. Les passion de l’âme troublent les sens, et leur font des impressions fausses. Ils mentent et se trompent à l’envie.” Although Pascal tells us here, as elsewhere, that reason, too, is only a source of error, it is obvious that the chief source of error are the senses (reason only takes it revenge) in the double sense of sense-perception and sensual passion.

Waldemar Gurian, in his excellent brief history of Bolshevism, Notre Dame 1952, gives for his understanding of the Bolshevik-Communist movement “as a social and political secular religion” chiefly the following reason: “What believers of traditional religions ascribe to God and what Christians ascribe to Jesus Christ and the Church, the Bolsheviks ascribe to the allegedly scientific laws of social, political, and historical development, which ... they have formulated in the doctrine established by Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin. Therefore, their acceptance of these doctrinal laws ... can be characterized as a secular religion.” p. 5.

As far as I can see, the term occurred first in a definite terminological meaning and with respect to modern totalitarian movements in a small book by Erich Vögelin, Die Politischen Religionen, 1938, in which he himself quotes as his only predecessor Alexander Ular, Die Politik. (in the series Die Gesellschaft, edited by M. Buber, vol. 3, 1906) The latter maintains that all political authority has a religious origin and a religious nature, and that politics itself is necessarily religious. His demonstrations he derives primarily from primitive tribal religions; his whole argument can be summed up in the following sentence: “The medieval god of the Christians is in fact nothing but a totem of monstrous dimensions ... The Christian is his child as the Australian native is the child of the kangorooh (Beutelschwein?).” In his early book, Voegelin himself still uses primarily examples from Tibetan religions as justification of his argument. Although he later abandoned this line of reasoning entirely, it is noteworthy that the term originally derived from anthropological studies, and not from an interpretation of Western tradition per se. Anthropological and tribal psychological implications of the term are still quite manifest in its use in the social sciences.

37. 
It is characteristic of all of Plato’s dialogues on justice that some break occurs right in the discussion where the strictly argumentative process has to be abandoned. In the Republic, Socrates eludes his questioners several times; the baffling question is whether justice is still possible if it is hidden from men and gods. See especially the break 372 a which is taken up again in 427d where he defines wisdom and euboulia; he comes back to the main question in 430d and discusses sôphosyné. He then starts again in 433b and comes almost immediately to a discussion of the forms of government, 445d ff., until the 7th book with the cave story puts the whole argument on an entirely different, non-political level. Here it becomes clear why Glaukôn cannot receive a satisfactory answer: Justice is an idea and must be perceived; that is the only possible demonstration.
