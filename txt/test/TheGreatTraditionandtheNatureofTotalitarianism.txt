The Great Tradition and the Nature of Totalitarianism

NEW SCHOOL. March 18, 53 - April 22, 53

I. 3/18/53.
No attempt to describe phenomenon or explain it out of its historical and political context.
Essay in understanding: as a novel form of government. Therefore help of the great tradition and the traditional definitions of government.

Understanding and preliminary understanding; the signifi­cance of new words and the attempt to equate them with something well known.

•The frightening aspect that it new in the sense that we cannot understand it: incapacity of judging.

This incapacity of judging shows itself
a) in growing stupidity as incapacity to subsume under general rules. This is general phenomenon. It means breakdown of morality as mores, and of authority of law. Publicity and psychoanalysis. Self-interest.
b) at the other end stands the sohpisticated paradox in those who try to understand: The means have prevailed over the ends. Or: that I am alive is my guilt. Each paradox expresses something in seeming precision. But its being a paradox shows that the usual categories do no longer apply.

Understanding and meaning: the growing meaninglessness of the world. Understanding not theorizing and applying theory to practical matters. Understanding as other side of action. Understanding as becoming at home in the world in which we live anyhow, but as strangers.

•Three attempts at understanding in this sense have been made:
1. Immanentist heresy: Totalitarianism the last conse­quence of doctrines that denied transcendence and pretended to find either the divine within this world or denied the divine altogether. Both the same because the ultimate meaning of this world is in this world. The great sin of totalitarianism is the attempt at earthly paradise.

Secularization: the attempt to realize or see the divine on earth. To abolish the distinction between the earthly existence of man and his ultimate destiny.

Implication: return to the orthodox authority.

Fallacy: 1. The notion that an idea has this kind of influ­ence seems phantastic. Why now and not rather in the fifth or the twelfth century. The actually existing difference between reality and idea completely blurred. Neglect of all historical factors.
2. Return to authority is question begging. This precisely impossible. When I use the authority for pragmatic reasons, I destroy it. The point is that all three: Religion, authority and tradition broke down. This is a fact, and not a theory.

▸
There is one great truth in this and the basic experience hidden in this theory: The old alternative between Man the Measure and God the Measure. I can measure only by something which transcends the measured. Plato’s realm of eternal ideas and the story of the cave: To win the Eidos accoding to which human affairs can be regulated. I reamin without yardstick if I do not accept something which transcends or somebody who transcends. • If it is true that judgment is subsumtion under general rules, then judgment ultimately only possible in belief of transcendence. Thou shalt not kill only through God’s command. Otherwise an opinion against which stands: Thou shall kill—and let us see how it works out. Where can I get my measurements? My standards of judgment.

•2. The opposite one as it were: Technology is the cause of everything. For this: Industrial revolution. Much nearer to reality. Technology implies mastery over nature, that is a rule by violence. We violate nature and thereby the natural order of things. We do not longer know the natural order of things. •This has come about through Plato. Realm of Ideas or God as transcendent yardstick implied negation of the earth, the will to power over the earth. We experience now a kind of revolution of the elements. Die Elemente sind mit uns verschworen und auf Zerstörung läuft’s hinaus. We fabricate everything and have forfeited our earthly existence in the midst of what was given to us.

The fallacy is obvious: Without fabrication, man cannot live. Technical development is a fact without which we would have the greatest catastrophe. To live in the midst of nature only savages do, and they are not human.

•The truth in it: The realm of ideas springs from the experience in fabrication: Eidos. Contemplation on one hand and violence in fabrication on the other. No place for action. This contemplation could be applied to technical development as soon as men cared to apply.

•3. Doom as the professional disease of the historians who see end everywhere. Obviously more plausible than progress which can never be automatic. But neither can doom. Both are processes and man is by definition unpredictable.
The historians sees end everywhere because of the truth that only what has found an end can be told and completely understood. Nemo ante mortem beatum dici potest. But History is not identical with historical periods: It has many beginnings and no end.

•What counts for politics which is in the present and concerns present actions is that man is a beginning. Without this we could not act. For Politics the beginning as important as the end for the historian. What we want to dinf out is something new, regardless of whether we like it or not.

▸
All attempts at understanding characterized by throwing out politics itself. The old contempt for politics and for action. Politically: New form of government. This some­thing quite unheard of. Compare with traditional forms of government.
Great Tradition: From Plato to Hegel.
Our Attitude toward tradition: No guidance, the thread is broken. Nobody can help it. What broke down is the Roman continuity with its meaning of reliion, authority and tradition. But neither piety nor faith nor the past.
The difference between Past and tradition. Past as a di­mension of man, in which alone he can experience great­ness and finality. In this respect, the past is eternal. It is a dimension, not a chronology and not a line. Mythology first attempt of man to create for himself this past, before he had any memories. Without a past, we are no longer human.

We can only measure ourselves, we do not get measure­ments. If it is true that man is by definition a beginning, insofar as he is capable of action, there must be a thinking which is not merely subsumtion or conclusion. Understanding is one of the many possible ways to think without subsuming or concluding. We shall see how this can be done and if it can be done. Reconciliation as against rebellion and resignation.
To understand the new form of government we have to understand anew, in the light of our own experiences, the traditional forms and the experiences which they expressed. Experiences of living-together, of Men and not Man.

II.
Forms of Government: Dichotomy between rulers and ruled. The question always: Who has the power: One man—monarchy; or a few—aristocracy; or many—democracy.
Against this: What kind of rule is it? According to laws or without laws? According to the interests of a few or one or to the interests of all?: According to this there are only constitutional or unconstitutional government. Here comes the concept of tyranny. If we ask: Who rules, the answer is the Law.

Against this a third possibility: Neither law nor power: Basileia and polity: Leader as princeps inter pares who is in agreement with followers who follow voluntarily, bound by unwritten treaties. Or Polity: The actual experi­ence of Greek poleis: The politeuein starts after the laws have been given by some lawgiver, either a God or a wise man. Men living together, bound together by a contract and their god-given laws. Nobody rules actually.

Plato: Five forms of government: Kingship, aristocracy,—three bad ones: timocracy, oligarchy (perversions of aristocracy) and democray. Obvious that these are actually three with their perversions: Monarchy-tyranny, aristocracy-oligarchy, democracy- ochlocracy.
These according to something human, residing in human experience: The three faculties of the soul: Nous, thymos, desire or appetite. Nous equals kingship; thymos equals (military) aristocracy; desire equals democracy. Because only the philosopher ▸| one by definition, is ruled by the nous; only a few are subject to courage; and the many follow blindly their desires.

Decisive here that the experiences which are at the basis of the forms of government are experiences which I make with myself. Therefore, fit to rule only who can rule himself. Self-discipline as the prerequisite of commands. The ideal ruler is the one who knows how to obey himself. Laws are of course secondary here, they are only the substitute for the techne of ruling first of all ruling oneself.

Montesquieu: Three forms of government: monarchies, republics, and tyrannies. Both question of law and power combined in the question of: What makes a government such as it is, what is it¿ structure. The answers: Power according to law in the hands of one or of the people or unlawful power according to the arbitrary will and desire of the tyrant.

•The elements from Plato are obvious. But now comes the new question: Principle of action: What makes people act as they act? First: Principle of motion not only of perversion, but realization that all communities somehow constantly change without changing toto coelo and finding the principle according to which change comes about, as the principle of action.

Three principles of action: Virtue (passionate interest in common affairs), honor, fear. These are not motives but criteria, and they are the standards for both rulers and ruled. Every action is judged according to this.

What is the fundament of virtue, honor, fear? Fundament of virtue is “love for equality” or experience of equality. What is equal? The fallacy of the confusion between homoiotes, identity or similarity in essence, and the koinon, the equality where there is something in common. Equal we are in the sphere of the common insofar as we have the possibility to understand each other and to act together. The basic experience is the joy of not being alone, and this means with my together with my equals. (One is one and all alone and ever more shall be so)

•Honor: Love of distinction. Equally original. In being together I make the experience of being distinct and therefore can acquire distinction. I come into my own by competing, measuring myself with other. Honor is the public recognition for this particular being who I am. This is my honor, Honorable is what does not destroy this distinction and the respect for it.

III.
Nature of government: Essence: Law and Power; Principle of Action: Virtue, Honor, Fear; Underlying experience: Equality, Distinction, Impotence.

What are these laws whose abolishment constitutes tyranny? Distinction between Source of Authority (God or ius naturale) and positive laws. Positive laws are being posited in accordance with the One eteneral law. Translate the Command ▸| of God into human standards of right and wrong. Their source superhuman, but their translation into laws by men. This is the legislative power which is always directed, is always being measured by something superhuman.

(But this superhuman indicates itself either in our reason as common sense or in our conscience, as the voice of God.)

The posited laws are seen in the image of fences or boundaries. They are not eternal, but permanent, relatively more stable than men. They fence in the movements, that is the action of men. The laws of distinction as against the laws of equality: the ones hedge in equally powerful men, the others help, by giving a gradual freedom of movement, in being distinct. The laws are between people and constitute & articulate the space in-between. (Therefore relationships where no laws exist: Love friendship, because of closeness: no in-between. The moment where the Between exists, we need certain rule¿¿ Therefore, no laws to protect people against themselves. This is the Platonic error!

Tyranny as springing from excessive democracy: If the laws of equality are rased, men not in their distinction but in their equality of strength, which is the equality of ability to kill, are no longer separated from each other. The political space disappears, the desert emerges. In case of monarchical and aristocratic governments, what remains are distinctions sanctioned by customs, therefore tyranny much less easy. Distintion are anchored in private life, where we are distinct from each other, not exclusively in public life where we are equal primarily because we are equal before the law. Therefore, if laws fail us in a republic, much more dangerous; no principle left for private life.

Fear in the desert of tyranny the only reliable guide and inspirer. Fear and distrust of tyrant against people and vice versa.

Political action in Republics: Equally strong men act together and power springs into being. In kingships and aristocracies: Some people guide and lead the way; they start something which the others help to bring to a good end. Each distinctly in his own way. In tyrannies: No action possible, therefore not permanent; destroyed from within because of lack of power. The strength of everybody cancels everybody else’s strength.

Resume: Laws are stabilizing factor to hedge in the actions of man. Without them, no action possible. The desert or the quiet of the cemetery. Man seen as something moving, institutions and laws as something permanent. The principle of action and the specific stabilizing forces in each form of government are united on the basis of one experience. This experience always common to us all, but not always the foundation of a body politic.

Question therefore: What is the essence, what is the principle of action and what is the uniting experience of the totalitarian form of domination?

▸
IV
To understand totalitarianism we enlisted the help of Montesquieu in order to know what questions to ask. Understanding is not condoning, but reconciliation. If other forms of government reside in experiences which we all have in living together, then we look for such experiences in totalitarian form of domination. Otherwise: What makes it be as it is? What sets it into motion? What makes it bearable for people, to which basic experience does it correspond?

Montesquieu: Republic: Equality of powerful men who act together out of joy of not being alone. This the political principle par excellence. Laws. Monarchy: Distinction of distinct people who follow the most distinguished who leads the way (archein) in order to see something through (prattein). This is the social principle par excellence. Customs. Tyranny: Isolation of equally powerful men who become impotent. Arbitrary action guided by fear and mistrust.
•The danger in a Republic: To pervert distinction into discrimination and to forget that men are not allpowerful: Death-limit to action. The danger in a Monarchy: To abolish equality which is the basis of distinction. This the difference between kingship and monarchy. The danger in a tyranny: To contradict the strictly political condition of man and to die of lack of power.

These definitions rest on the criterion of lawfulness whose opposite is arbitrariness. Laws are the stabilizing factors for men in motion.
How about interest? Does the tyrant not rule for his own interest•? Aristotle introduced the principle of interest: The rule in the interest of a few, of the many, of one man only. Can one man in isolation still have interest? Inter-esse. Sympheron. Wherever people live together they have something which is between them, that is interests. Only in the sphere of the Between can interests exist. One man alone is indeed like Plato’s tyrant, a wolf with desires precisely because he has no interests, nothing which he holds in common wit others. Interests only where people have something in common. The smallest unit the family. Therefore the married tyrant has interests. This usually the end of tyranny. (Hitler’s remark about Napoleon.) Interests instead of laws the justified approach of the social sciences. Marx: Class interest: This a tautology. The fallacy: it seems as though Interest is something objective [because what we have in common. Rohan.] which precludes the unpredictability of the actions of man. Polit. science deal with Action.

The new Laws of Movement: Law of Nature as against natural law:• The law of the cosmos which is permanent. The introduction of Development through Darwin and Marx: The law of development: Survival of the fittest in struggle of races; survival of one class in the interest of mankind in the struggle for mankind. One race and One class, through which development takes place. Mankind ultimately direct embodiment of this movement law.

▸
The Laws of Development scientifically stated: Predictability of Future, of the course of future history. What is the role of man? To be embodiment and to execute them in order to speed them up. Anything impredictable becomes an obstacle for the Movement itself. The irrelevance of human action as execution of Movement.

Translation into positive law: Instead of this: Terror. Terror has two objects: to speed up the law of movement by eliminating the classes or races which are unfit. And to prevent the unpredictable actions of man. To prevent all kind of spontaneity: Fear as well as convictions as guides to action. Terror liberates the forces of Nature or History and freezes man. (Die Elemente sind mit uns verschworen und auf Zerstörung läufts hinaus.) Destruction because of the truth about such movements: Movement without the interference of man which is always unpredictable is ruinous for man. Not for nature as a whole, where every­thing goes on in repeating circles, but for human beings who cannot live as natural beings. The stream of happening and Events. To let loose the elements. The Iron band of terror as against the fences of the law. Terror rules supreme like law when nobody opposes any longer. Terror binds together those who were isolated and impotent.

Terror supports and sweeps into movement isolated human beings. Terror makes totalitarian government be what it is, insofar as terror is freed of conviction and fear, and executes movement.

Under these conditions, the can be no principle of action properly speaking because action always acts against movement of elements. Instead of this: Preparation which prepares every single man for either victim or executioner with equal precision.
The purges where the purgers are being purged.

This is achieved through ideology:
What is an ideology: Ism. Example Jew hatred and antisemitism. God in Deism. Jews or God have become the instrument of total explanation. Compare with God in theology: The fact of revelation, like animals in zoology.
Ideology: The logos of an idea, the science of an idea? Like the science of experienced matter? Zoology? In Marxism class is an idea as race in racism. It can also be the subject matter of a science. What is the difference?

•The idea of class or the idea of race are the instruments to explain the Movement, the Development. The idea develops “logically”—this the sense of ideo-logy—the future course of happening. If you take the idea, everything is logically explain ed. The idea becomes a premise in the logical sense from which a process is being deduced. Thinking in terms of conclusions instead of judgment, subsumtion under certain rules.

Totalitarian ideology: Take this seriously and say: You can’t say A without saying B. Stalin: Lenin’s “force of logic overpowered the audience” like a mighty tentacle it seizes you on all sides as in a vise from whose grip you are powerless to tear yourself away. Hitler’s ice-cold reasoning. The people who cannot come to the conclu­sions of their own assumptions.
This logical process devours the idea. What is important is the process itself. The idea of classless society or master race ▸| if realized would stop the movement forever. What then? Totalitarian domination is the execution of this movement. Therefore: State—legal institution the stable framework—is being sac ificed to the people, and the people to the movement.

Logical thinking as expressed in You cant say A without saying B based on our fear of contradiction. Originally, a control of thought, not productive in itself. Inner compulsion. Freedom identical with beginning: If you say only B, no freedom possible. You yourself become predictable.
 
This the inner compulsion by which one prepares oneself.

V
Repetition: The law of movement as against stabilizing law is translated into terror as against positive law. Terror makes man conform to the movement of History or Nature; the assumption is that no man will do this voluntarily and 2nd •that voluntary conforming would not be reliable. The unpredictability of man. The point is that we must liberate the forces of nature or history and that the freedom of man is in the way of this liberation.•

Law of Nature or History is ultimately the same: Darwin’s theory of development is ultimately the history of nature, it tells the story of nature, it looks on nature as though it had a story to tell. This unilinear movement as against the circular movement of nature which we experience and which was the all-ruling movement in traditional philosophy. Nature is being swept into history, its movement is being assimilated to historical experience.
Marx’ theory on the other side sees the decisive moment in the development of the production forces and the production are ultimately based on labor taken as a force, the metamormophosis of man with nature for the sake of conserving his own individual life and reproducing the species. (Wage-theory) Within a natural setting, man is seen as the highest natural force. Productive force is a natural force though the highest.

To look at everything from the point of view of being a “force” foreshadows the conspiracy with the elements. Labor is the force that liberates the elements.

The survival of the fittest race or the fittest class foreshadows (or expresses) the notion that men may be superfluous and parasites. Who is not useful for this process is not “fit to live”. This ultimately based on the new society of laborers. Who has not his work given to him by society is superfluous, is a parasite, etc. This ends in liquidation of those who are no longer needed. The revolutionary concept of Labor which is common to all new doctrines.

▸
Ideology: (See p. 7-8)
The inner compulsion is deducing. This the process by which I swing myself into motion and the process which sets the idea into motion. Not the idea seizes the masses but logi Deducing or concluding and judging: In order to judge I need a) Rules under which I subsume; Socrates was a great philosopher. b) Other people to control my senses: the sky is blue. (The psychological experiement.)
We said already that common sense has broken down in the sense of valid rules for judgment. Now: Common sense is also the sense common to us all as against the particularity of the five senses. With common sense I fit my particular senses into a world which we all inhabit.
Deduce or conclude I can by myself. I do not need anybody else, and I do not need common sense. because I don’t need senses.

•Loneliness and isolation: Isolation political, loneliness personal, private, social. I can be isolated without being lonely and vice versa. In isolation I lose capacity for action; in loneliness, I lose the common sense, the sense for what we have in common.

In loneliness I deduce one from the other and think everythin¿ to the worst.• (Luther) The logical axioms of not contradictin¿ yourself becomes the only reliable thing after the loss of common sense. If I cant realize the dialogue of soli-

Loneliness and uprootedness: Out of uprootedness, losing one’s place in the world comes loneliness as general experience. Who is uprooted is superfluous. I am lonely when I am superfluous. when I have no place in the world. The growth of superfluity since and with imperialism: export of superfluous men and money. (America did not know it.) Parasites.
Uprootedness and surface-men:• Men swept over the surface, men hungry for a movement because they have lost their place. Loss of depth and experience of the bottomless pit. Depth we gain through striking roots.
Understanding is striking roots in the world as it is. This is the meaning of understanding as reconciliation. (As opposed to both resignation and rebellion. As distinguished from forgiving.)

•Loneliness and solitude: Cato: never less solus than when solus, never more active than when nothing doing.
Solitude: I am by myself, together with myself, and with every body. The dialogue of thought which is pure activity.
Epictet, Diss. 3, 13; one can talk with oneself. Zeus after the fire of the world. distinction between monos and eremos. Eremos identified with helplessness.

The duplication of solitude in which I am equivocal and never One. I become one through the others who identify me. My thoughts come into the realm of the common where common sense judges them and where I talk about them. Against the thinking dialogue where I think of something and think something through, but not about something.

▸
I have lost the world and myself, that is capacity for thought and for experience. The axiomatic selfevident receives new emphasis: No longer control to protect me but productive. I am One but without anybody to confirm my identity. I do no longer trust my sense because they are no longer confirmed by common sense. I cant have any judgment.

Solitude can become loneliness: Philosophers as the solitary men who decided about our political philosophy. Plato’s two statements: Pragmata dont deserve full seriousness and the best for the ideal law would be if there were only One man. In both instance, plurality seens as something disturbing. (This the only connection between totalitarianism which treats men as mankind, as One man and traditional philosophy.)
Solitude became loneliness for the first time with Hegel. Hegel and Nietzsche. Anecdotes. Crime and Punishment. The logical crim¿

Loneliness can always become solitude. Nietzsche, Zarathustra. Then you are politically speaking no longer lonely but only isolated. Solitude the position of people under conditions of tyranny, that is the great productive chance of isolation that it becomes solitude. Therefore the secret love of the philosophers for tyrannical government.
Totalitarianism takes care that loneliness remains and that solitude cannot develop. You can be lonely among many people, but never solitary. Therefore they do not leave you alone. Te They do not permit you to isolate yourself.

If tyranny an anti-political principle, then totalitarianism an anti-social and anti-human principle. Loneliness almost the only thing which men cannot bear, precisely because they are created in the plural. The self in solitude indicates this plural, is never enough. Yet ..

VI.
Repeat: Logicality, the logic which devours the idea whenever ideology is being made the principle of action or taken as fundament of a body politic. Not the idea, but its logic seizes the masses. This logic replaces the common sense, the sense common to us all. It becomes now the controlling instance of the senses: Nicht sein kann, was nicht sein darf.
Logic also common to us all but in altogether different sense: Logical men are really identical; not even God can change the rules of logic means: From a logical point of view not even God is different from men. Common sense regulates the differences of equality; logic expresses identity. The destruction of plurality. Only One man thinks when we think logically, because no other could arrive at a different conclusion.

This is the thinking of loneliness where I preserve a hollow identity through avoiding contradictions and remain in contact with others only because all others are like me literally. Exchangeable.

▸
Loneliness: among others; (Epikt.) with whom you lose contact, Lonely people cant be alone. Lost: isolation & Solitude.
Loneliness—isolation—solitude: Isolation the prerequisite of tyranny destroys or makes unable to act, destroys the sphere of the common, but not space between men altogether. Isolation is required for all making of things: I get away from the world of men and add something new to the human artifice. I am absorbed in the world, by making one thing, I remain in contact with everything. Leave only men. This not true for labor: No isolation, “privacy” necessary: rule over slaves tendency toward totalitarian. Isolation becomes loneliness under conditions of Labor. Chief characteristics of Labor: Forced by anagkaia, immediate consumption, endless repitition Fabrication: relative permanence of object which is being used; end of the process is the product
Solitude: Isolation is the prerequisite of solitude. In solitude thinking in whose dialogue I am in contact with everybody, and myself.
In Loneliness: I lose both self and world, the faculties of thought and experience and making things, creativity in the largest sense.
The first invasion of loneliness through the transformation of solitude ihnto loneliness: Nietzsche—horse; Hegel on his deathbed. Then: isolation into loneliness: Laborers.
Philosophers the only ones for whom solitude condition of their work; they need to be left alone. Their best “government” is tyranny in the enlightened way. The philosophers’ secret love for benevolent tyrants: Plato, Spinoza, Nietzsche.

Political philosophy: What is the attitude of the philosophers to politics?
1. From Plato to Madison: “Government is nothing but a reflection on human nature. If were angels we did not need it.” (Madison) The less people are occupied or need worry, the better the government. (Nietzsche)
2. Why? Plato: Human pragmata are not worth of full seriousness; they are the sphere of opinions as against truth. In this sphere, nothing can be made out. Everything changes.
3. The nature of acting: “Our thoughts are ours; their ends never our own.” We act into a web of relationships and never know what will be the end. Our purposes are constantly frustrated.
4. But politics is necessary because we live together with other people and man is not independent. The best for keeping the law, according to Plato, if there were only one man. Plurality seen as annoying:
a) Because it interferes with isolation and solitude.
b) because it accounts for opinions instead of truth.
c) because it makes us dependent on others.
5. Politics necessary for two reasons:
•a) in order to keep alive: Therefore the materialist basis, interests, or rule over slaves the beginning of politics in Aristotle: rule over the necessary things of life in order to be free for good life. We are forced into politics because of our “bodies” in the widest sense. We rule others as we rule our bodies.
b) the fear of being ruled by people less good than yourself.
6. Political activity seen as the art of statesmanship: This art construed according to two models: Physician who also deals with the body; or the hersman, the shepherd. Fallacy seen already by Plato that difference in kind would be required. The rule of the statesman-philosopher supposes such a difference in kind.
This rule according to Reason, or the “ideal” order: The tyranny of Reason. (“Tis dream to think that reason can/ govern the reasoning creature man.”) This rule possible only if there is a transcendent realm of Reason which we only apply. Otherwise: we are▸| all reasoning creatures. Plato’s contemplation of ideas: No way to action out of contemplation, out of this absorption into something not earthly. Distinction to thinking which never leaves the dialogue and therefore never becomes altogether enrapt.
All idealistic philos. presupposes a materialistic concept of politics All political life therefore exists for something which is not political: it has a higher goal. This runs through the whole tradition, not even Marx who bestowed an unheard of dignity on politics ever thought of political life as an end in itself.
Which were these ultimate goals?
The bios theoretikos, contemplation, in Greece.
The summum bonum or the Commonweal in Christianity.
The Happiness of the greatest number in recent times.
The chief evil: Power: This only justified by the black sheep
Hobbes and Macchiavelli. But Power precisely the indica­tion of an independent dignity of Politics.

Against these philosophies and their goals stand actual experiences which do not coincide.
1. The Greek experience: Archein in the sense of begin­ning a common enterprise and follow a leader into it. (Homer) Or Politeuein, the life in the city which could begin only after the laws had been given and which now moved within its walls. Everything public went into it, but chiefly court matters, the decision between citizens and theater.
2. The Roman experience: Foundation and preservation of civities (Cicero) The great pathos of the first beginning which then was carried into the Roman Church where everthing begins with Christ. Here the birth place of tradition-authority-religion. The Foundatio carries with it all later obligation, first of all the obligation of preservation given in tradition; it has the greatest authority over Man because man when he has started once in freedom is no longer free. This is the sense of the Roman laws. The pathos of Foundation is Freedom; the pathos of Preservation is Obligation. You are obliged by what you or your forefathers did precisely because the first deed was free and therefore something like God’s creation our of nothing. Similar in greatness.
3. The Christian experience: In living together, the Chris­tians discovered love as a relevant experience! But love can rule the relationships of men only if it is the love of God, that is the love with which God loves us that we love our neighbors. Solidarity. Much more important but in connection: Forgiving. Lord forgive them for they dont know what they do. Forgiving necessary for two reasons: 1. Because we can never really know what we are doing. 2. Because we give each other the chance to begin anew. The right of Mercy therefore always in Christian countries the highest prerogative of the Executive. The recognition that Justice is never enough.

4. The experience of the French and American Revolu­tion: Law giving. Man as his own legislator, not obeying other people but himself. This the new concept of freedom. It rests on “starred sky above me and the moral law within me.” (Kant) Still natural law, but this natural law has become something interior. It is in myself.

▸
The pre-revolutionary political philosophy: Locke and Rousseau: Locke theory of property: Mine is what I make, where I mix the labor of my body with matter. This resides on the fact that the first thing a man owns is his body. Property itself no longer something which belongs and is between men, but which originates in myself. Rousseau: The volonté générale is the innate reasonable will from which laws spring. Laws no longer between us but springing from us.
The last law within ourselves is logic: 2+2=4.

All these experiences need to be preserved as against the philosophies which simply did not pay much attention. We add to them our own by understanding them better, actually in the light of our experiences.

Present spiritual situation: After the three jumps: The jump into faith by Pascal and Kierkegaard from reason brought doubt (solitude) into faith and destroyed unquestioned religion.
The jump of Marx from theory into Action carried the specific po litical philosophy from Plato to Hegel into action and destroyed action.
The jump of Nietzsche from nihilism into Life carried the nihilistic question: Is life worth at all? into living.

But this only the least important side. Important is the actual event which cannot be repaired.
Understanding: Reconciliation, not forgiving, that is striking roots, instead of running away where one hopes that roots still are—buy a farm or shop for a religion. Thus we regain the dimension of depth, not as an experi­ence of the void in anxiety as for the surface-men and not as a compulsory process of arguing the self-evident from the premises as logical men.
Understanding in this sense is the prerequisite or the other side of action: Only if I am rooted in the central experi­ences of my time, can I begin anew—that is act politically.
Action to a large extent always re-action against the ruinous stream of mere happening into which the ideologies want to lure us. The beginning of freedom is resistance.
The idea of Freedom has little to do with the notion of an arbitrary choice between good and evil. Freedom is the capacity of beginning. Initum ut esset homo creatus est. As such it is a mere potentiality. Its reality in the political sense is the space between men guaranteed by laws.
Laws: We cannot live without them yet we do not believe in natural law or the Law of God; the old idea of the Revolutions are still true, though their specific notions: Man is the measure of Laws and carries this measure as the Voice of conscience within himself, no longer holds.
The first most elementary form of law making is making a promise: This is the legislative capacity of man: Animal that can make promises. (Nietzsche) Keeping of promises. Islands of reliability into the future.
