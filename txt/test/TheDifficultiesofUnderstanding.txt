The Difficulties of Understanding

Many people say that one cannot fight totalitarianism without understanding it. This, fortunately is not true; otherwise our case would be hopeless. Understanding, as distinguished from correct information and scientific knowledge, is a complicated process which never produces unequivocal results. It is an unending activity by which, in constant change and variation, we come to terms with, reconcile ourselves to reality, that is try to be at home in the world. The fact that reconciliation is inherent in understanding has given rise to the popular misrepresentation of tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner. Yet, forgiving has so little to do with understanding that it is neither its condition nor its consequence. Forgiving,—certainly among the greatest human capacities and perhaps the boldest of human actions insofar as it tries the seeming impossible, the undoing of what has been done, and succeeds in making a new beginning where everything seemed to have come to an end,—is one action and culminates in one act. Understanding is unending and therefore cannot produce end-results; it is the specifically human way of being alive insofar as every single person needs to be reconciled to a world into which he has been born as a stranger and in which, to the extent of his distinct uniqueness, he always remains a stranger. Understanding begins with birth and ends with death. To the extent that the rise of totalitarian governments is the central event of our world, the understanding of totalitarianism does not mean to condone anything, but to reconcile ourselves to a world in which these things have been possible at all.

The difficulties to understand

  Many people say that one cannot fight totalitarianism without understanding it. This, fortunately, is not true; otherwise our case would be hopeless. True understanding, as distinguished from correct information, is a complicated process which never produces unequivocal results. It is an unending activity which in constant change and variation engenders meaning. The reason for this unreliability is that we, who seek and try to tell the truth, are alive and changing ourselves. “It is difficult to tell the truth; it is true there is only one truth, but truth is alive and has a living changing face.” (Franz Kafka, Briefe an Milena, p.   )
  Many well-meaning people want to short-cut this process in order to educate others and to improve public opinion. The result of such attempts is indoctrination. As an attempt at understanding it transcends the comparatively solid realm of facts and figures, from whose infinity it seeks to escape; as a short-cut of the transcending process itself, which is arbitrarily interrupted by pronouncing some of its statements as though they had the reliability of facts and figures, it destroys the activity of understanding altogether. Indoctrination is dangerous because it springs primarily from a perversion of understanding, and not of knowledge. The result of understanding is meaning, which we originate in the very process of living insofar as we try to understand what we do and what we suffer.
  Indoctrination can help only the totalitarian fight against us. The free world will not only do a very poor job in this field compared with totalitarian propaganda and education; by employing and training its own “experts”, who pretend to “understand” factual information in adding a pseudo-scientific “evaluation” to research results, it can only further those elements of totalitarian thinking which exist today in all free societies.
▸
  This, however, is only one side of the matter. We cannot wait with our fight against totalitarianism until we have “understood” it, because we do not, and cannot expect to understand it definitely as long as it has not definitely been defeated. The understanding of political and historical matters, since they are profoundly and fundamentally human matters, have something in common with the understanding of people: who somebody essentially is we can know only after he is dead. For mortals, the final and the eternal begins only after death.
  The most obvious escape from this predicament is the equation of totalitarian government with some well-known evil of the past—such as aggressiveness, tyranny, conspiracy, et. al. Here, it seems, we are on solid ground; for together with its evils, we think we have inherited the wisdom of the past to guide us through them. Yet, the trouble with the wisdom of the past is that it dies as it were in our hands as soon as we try to apply it honestly to the central political experiences of our own time. Everything we know of totalitarianism ▸| —of its institutions, actions and policies—proves a horrible originality which no far-fetched historical parallels can alleviate and from whose impact we can escape only if we decide not to focus our attention on its very nature but let it run away into the interminate connections and similarities which certain tenets of totalitarian doctrine necessarily show with familiar theories of occidental thought, similarities which on one hand are inescapable because in the realm of pure theory and isolated concepts there can be nothing new under the sun, and which on the other disappear completely if one neglects the theoretical formulation and concentrates on its practical application. The originality of totalitarianism is horrible, not because something new came into the world, but because its very actions constitute a clear break with all our traditions and have caused a tangible explorsion of all our categories of political thought and all our standards for moral judgment. In other words, the very event and phenomenon which we try, and must try to understand has deprived us of our traditional tools of understanding. Nowhere was this perplexing condition clearer revealed than in the abysmal failure of the Nuremberg Trials where one attempted to reduce the Nazi demographic policies to the criminal concepts of murder and persecution, with the result that the very enormity of the crimes, on one hand, made all conceivable punishment somewhat ridiculous, and that, on the other, even this punishment could never be accepted as “legal” because it presupposed together with the obedience to the command Thou Shalt Not Kill a possible range of murderous motives, that is of those qualities which cause a man to become a murderer and make him a murderer, which quite obviously were completely absent in the accused.
  Understanding, while it cannot be expected to provide any results which are specifically helpful or inspiring in the fight against totalitarianism, must accompany this fight insofar as it is more than a mere fight for survival. Insofar as ▸| as totalitarian movements have sprung up in the midst of the non-totalitarian world (demonstrably crystallizing elements whose origin could be found in it and traced back into its traditions), since totalitarian governments have not been imported from the moon, the process of understanding is clearly, and perhaps primarily, also a process of self-understanding. For while we only know, but do not yet understand, what it is we are fighting against, we know and understand even less what we are fighting for. And the resignation, so characteristic of Europe during the last war and so precisely formulated by an English poet “that we who lived by noble dreams defend the bad against the worse”, will no longer be sufficient. In this sense, the activity of understanding is necessary; while it can never inspire the fight directly or provide otherwise missing objectives, it alone can make it meaningful and prepare a new resourcefulness of the human mind and the human heart which perhaps will come into free play only after the battle is won.
  Knowledge and understanding are not the same, but they are interrelated. Understanding is based on knowledge and knowledge cannot proceed without a preliminary, inarticulate understanding. Preliminary understanding denounces totalitarianism as tyranny and has decided that our fight against it is a fight for freedom. True is that whoever cannot be mobilized on these grounds, will probably not be mobilized at all. But the denial of freedom, albeit in a more radical form, totalitarian government has in common with a great many forms of government, and, for the understanding of its nature, it is not of primary importance. Preliminary understanding, however, no matter how rudimentary and even irrelevant it may ultimately prove to be, will certainly do more to prevent people from joining a totalitarian movement than the most reliable information, the most perceptive political analysis or the most comprehensive accumulated knowledge.
  Understanding precedes and succeeds knowledge. Preliminary understanding which is at the basis of all knowledge, and true understanding which transcends it, have this in common with ▸| each other that they, and they alone, can make knowledge meaningful. Historical dexcription and political analysis can never prove that there is such a thing at all as the nature or the essence of totalitarian government, just as there is the nature of monarchical, republican, tyrannical or despotic government. This specific nature is taken for granted by the preliminary understanding on which the sciences base themselves, and this preliminary understanding permeates as a matter of course, but not of critical insight, their whole terminology and vocabulary. True understanding always returns to the judgments and prejudices which preceded and guided the strictly scientific inquiry. The sciences can only illuminate, but neither prove nor disprove the uncritical preliminary understanding from which they start. If the scientist misguided by the very labors of inquiries begins to pose as an expert in politics and to despise that popular understanding from which he started, he loses immediately the Ariadne thread of common sense which alone will guide him securely through the labyrinth of his own results. If, on the other hand, the scholar wants to transcend his own knowledge—and there is no other way to make this knowledge meaningful but such a transcending—he must become very humble again and listen closely to popular language in which words like totalitarianism are daily used as political clih cliches and misused as catchwords in order to reestablish contact between knowledge and understanding.
  The popular use of the word totalitarianism for the purpose of denouncing some supreme political evil is not much older that about five years. Up to the end of World War II and even during the first post-war ywars, the catchword for political evil was imperialism. As such, it was generally used to denote aggressiveness in foreign politics; this identification was so thorough that the two words could easily be exchaged for each other. In much the same way, totalitarianism is used today to denote lust for power, will to dominate, terror and and a so-called monolithic state structure. The change itself ▸| is noteworthy; imperialism remained a popular catchword long after the rise of Bolshevism, Fascism and Nazism; people, obviously, had not yet caught up with events or did not believe that these new movements would eventually dominate the whole historical period. Not even the war with a totalitarian power, but only the actual downfall of imperialism, which was accepted after the liquidation of the British Empire and the reception of India into the British Commonwealth, marked the moment when the new event, totalitarianism, was admitted to have taken the place of imperialism as the central political issue of a new era.
  Yet while popular language thus recognizes a new event by accepting a new word, it invariably uses such concepts as synonyms for some others signifying old and familiar evils—aggressiveness and lust for conquest in the case of imperialism, terror and lust for power in the case of totalitarianism. The choice of the new word indicates that everybody knows that something new and decisive has happened, while its ensuing use, the identification with the new and specific phenomenon with something familiar and rather general, indicates the popular unwillingness to admit that anything out of the ordinary has happened at all. It is as though with the first step, finding a new name for a new force which will determine the course of our political destinies, we orient ourselves toward new and specific conditions, whereas with the second step—as it were on second thought—we regret our boldness and console ourselves that nothing worse or less familiar will take place than general human sinfulness.
  Popular language, as it expresses preliminary understanding thus starts the process of true understanding with a discovery which must always remain its actual content if it does not want to lose itself in the clouds of mere speculation, and a danger which will always remain present. It has been the common uncritical understanding of the people which more than anything else induced a whole generation of historians, ▸| economists and political scientists to devote their best efforts to the investigation of the causes and consequences of imperialism, and, at the same time, misrepresent it as “Empire building” after Assyrian or Egyptian or Roman fashion and misunderstand its underlying motives as “lust for conquest”, describing Cecil Rhodes as a second Napoleon and Napoleon as a second Julius Cesar. Totalitarianism, similarly, has become a current topic of study only since preliminary understanding recognized it as the central issue and the most significant danger of the time; and again, the current interpretations even on the highest scholarly level let themselves be guided further by the design of preliminary understanding and equate totalitarian domination with tyranny or one-party dictatorship, if they do not explain the whole thing away by reducing it to historical or social or psychological causes which can be relevant only for one country, Germany or Russia. It is evident that such methods do not help any effort at understanding because it makes disappear into a welter of familiarities and plausibilities whatever is unfamiliar and in need of being understood.
  True understanding is distinguished from public opinion in both its popular and scientific form by its refusal to let go the original intuition of preliminary understanding. Preliminary understanding that coins new words or suddenly endows already used words with a new and wider significance is prompted by the universal need for orientation in the world and indicates therefore always the precise moment when this world is really and deeply changed through a new event. Orientation is also one of the decisive motives for all scientific effort, and it is therefore only natural that preliminary understanding and science should remain so closely bound together. True understanding which is always a quest for meaning goes beyond both and therefore leads us back to what preliminary understanding saw and knew in the beginning.
▸
  Yet, has not the task of understanding become hopeless if it is true that we are confronted with something which has exploded our categories of thought and our standards of judgment? How can we measure any length if we do not have a yardstick, how could we count things without the notion of numbers? Maybe it is preposterous even to think that anything could ever happen which our categories are not equipped to understand. Maybe we should resign ourselves to the preliminary understanding, which at once ranges the new among the old, and with the scientific approach, which follows it and deduces methodically the unprecedented from precedents, even though their description of the new phenomena may be demonstrably at variance with the reality. Is not understanding so closely related to and interrelated with judging that one must describe the action of both as the subsumption of something particular under a universal rule which according to Kant is the very definition of judgment whose absence he so magnificently defined as “stupidity”, an “infirmity beyond remedy”? (Critique of Pure Reason, 2nd edition, note on p. 173)
  These questions are all the more pertinent as they are not restricted to our perplexity in understanding totalitarianism. The meaninglessness which has invaded the modern world is to a large extent due to our inability to understand meaningfully and judge securely. The paradox of the modern situation seems to be that our need to transcend preliminary understanding and the strictly scientific approach springs from the fact that we lost our tools of understanding. Our quest for meaning is at the same time prompted and frustrated through our inability to originate meaning. Kant’s definition of stupidity is by no means besides the point. Since the beginning of this century, the growth of meaninglessness has permanently been accompanied by an increasing loss of common sense. In many respects, this has appeared simply as growing stupidity of people. We do not know of any civilization before us in which people would be gullible enough to form their buying habits in accordance with the maxim that “self-praise is the highest recommendation”, which is the ruling maxim of all advertising. Nor is it very likely that any century before us would ▸| have been persuaded to take a therapy seriously which is said to help only if the sick person pays a considerable amount of money to those who administer it—unless, of course, there exists a primitive society where the handing over of money itself possesses magical power.
  What has happened to the little clever rules of self-interest, has happened on a much larger scale to all the spheres of ordinary life which, because they are ordinary, need to be regulated by customs. That these customs, together with their rules of behavior which quite literally constitute the morality, the mores, of any given civilization, were the only elements that prevented a moral and spiritual breakdown of occidental culture had been recognized as early as the eighteenth century and by no less an authority than Montesquieu. He certainly cannot be counted among the prophets of doom; yet his cold and sober courage has hardly been matched by any of the famous historical pessimist of the nineteenth century.
  The life of peoples, according to Montesquieu, are ruled by laws and by customs; they are distinguished in that “the laws rule rather actions of the citizen and the customs rule rather the actions of man.” (Esprit des Lois, Book XiX, ch. 16) Laws establish the realm of public, political life, and customs establish the realm of society. The downfall of nations begins with the undermining of lawfulness, be it that the laws are being abused by the government in power or that the authority, i.e. the very source of the law, becomes doubtful and questionable. In both instances, laws are no longer held valid and the result is that the nation, together with its “belief” in its own laws, loses its capacity for responsible political action; the people cease to be citizens in the full sense of the word. What then still remains (and incidentally explains the frequent longevity of political bodies whose lifeblood has ebbed away) are the customs and traditions of society. As long as they are intact, men as private individuals continue to behave according to certain patterns of morality. But this morality has lost its fundament. ▸| Totalitarian phenomena which can no longer be understood in terms of common sense and which defy all rules of “normal”, that is chiefly utilitarian judgment, are only the most spectactular instance of the breakdown of the traditional accumulated wisdom common to us all. From the point of view of common sense, we did not need the rise of totalitarianism to show us that we are living in a topsy-turvy world, that is a world where one cannot find one’s way by abiding to the rules of common sense. In this situation, stupidity in the Kantian sense has become the infirmity of everybody, and therefore can no longer be regarded as “beyond remedy”. Stupidity has become as common as common sense was previously; and this does not mean that it is a symptom of the mass-society or that “intelligent” people are exempt from it, the only difference being that stupidity remains inarticulate (and therefore is less offensive) among the non-intellectuals. Within the intelligentsia, one may even say that the more “intelligent” an individual happens to be, the more irrtating becomes the stupidity which he has in common with all.
▸
  Tradition can be trusted to prevent the worst only for a limited time. Every incident can destroy the customs and a morality which have no longer their fundament in lawfulness, every contingency must threaten a society which is no longer guaranteed by citizens.
  For his own time and its immediate prospects, Montesquieu had the following to say: “The majority of the nations of Europe are still ruled by customs. But if through a long misuse of power, if through some large conquest, despotism would establish itself at a given point, there would be neither customs nor climate which could resist; and in this beautiful part of the world, human natures would suffer, at least for a time, the insults which have been inflicted on it in the three others.” (ibidem, Book VII, ch. 8) In this passage, Montesquieu outlines the political dangers to a political body which is held together by customs and traditions only, that is by the mere binding force of morality. The dangers could appear from within, as misuse of power, or from without, as agression; the factor which eventually would bring the downfall of customs about in the beginning 19th century, he could not foresee; it came from that radical change of the modern world which we call the industrial revolution; this, certainly, is the greatest revolution in the shortest span of time mankind has ever witnessed; it changed in a few decades our whole globe more radically than the whole three thousand years of recorded history before it. Reconsidering Montesquieu fears which were voiced almost 100 years before this revolution had taken place in its whole magnitude, it is tempting, even though perhaps a bit idle, to reflect on the probable course of European civilization without the impact of this one, all-overriding factor. One conclusion seems inescapable: the great change took place within a political framework whose fundaments were no longer secure and overtook therefore a society which, although it was still able to understand and to judge, was no longer in a position to give account of its categories of understanding and standards of judgment if these should be challenged seriously. In other words, Montesquieu fears, ▸| which sound so strange in the eighteenth and would sound so commonplace in the nineteenth century, may at least give us a hint for the explanation—not of totalitarianism or any other specific modern event but—of the disturbing fact that our great tradition has remained so peculiarly silent, so obviously wanting in productive replies, when challenged by the “moral” and political questions of our own time. The very sources from which such answers should have flown had dried up even before the debris of the caved in framework, within which understanding and judging could orient themselves, had buried them.
  However, Montesquieu’s fears go even farther, and therefore came even closer to our present perplexity, than the above quoted passage would indicate. His main fear, which he puts at the head of his whole work (into its preface), concerns more than the welfare of the European nations and the continued existence of political freedom; it concerns human nature itself: “Man, this flexible being, who bends himself in society to the thoughts and expressions of others, is equally capable of knowing his own nature when it is shown to him as he is of losing it to the point where he has no sentiment of it any more (d’en predre jusqu’au sentiment) if he is being robbed of it.” To us, who are confronted with the very realistic totalitarian attempt at robbing man of his nature under the pretetx of changing it, the courage of these words is like the boldness of youth which may risk in imagination everything because nothing has happened as yet to supply the dangers outlined in the realm of the imaginary with their horrible concreteness. What is envisaged here is more than the loss of the capacity for political action, which is, as we shall see later, the central condition of tyranny, and more than the growth of meaninglessness and the loss of common sense (and common sense is only that part of our mind and that portion of the wisdom in any given civilization which we all have in common); it is the loss of the quest for meaning and need for understanding. We know how very close to this condition of meaninglessness which is no longer experienced as such totalitarian terror combined with training in ideological thinking hans ▸| has brought the people under its domination. In order to bring even this extreme condition of man threatened by the very loss of his nature back into the realm of human understanding (and thereby back under human control), we shall try later to discover whether a commonly shared human experience exists from which these inhuman and dehumanizing experiments spring, and if so what kind of experience this is. has brought the people under its domination.
  Noteworthy in our context is the peculiar and ingenious substitute of stringent logicality for common sense which is characteristic of totalitarian thinking. Logicality is not identical with ideological reasoning but indicates the totalitarian transformation of the respective ideologies. If it was the peculiarity of the ideologies to treat some scientific hypothesis, such as the survival of the fittest in biology or the survival of the most progressive class in history, as an “idea” by which the whole course of happenings, then it is the peculiarity of their totalitarian transformation to pervert the “idea” into a premise in the logical sense, that is into some self-evident statement from which everything else can be deduced in stringent logical consistency. (Here truth becomes indeed what some logicians pretend it to be, namely consistency, except that this equation actually implies the negation of the existence of truth insofar as truth is always supposed to reveal something, whereas consistency is only a mode of fitting statements together and as such lacks the power of revelation.) The new logical movement in philosophy which grew out of pragmatism has a frightening affinity with the totalitarian transformation of the pragmatic elements, inherent in all ideologies, into logicality which severes its bounds with reality and experience altogether although, of course, totalitarianism proceeds in a cruder fashion, which, unfortunately, by the same token is also more effective.) The chief political distinction between common sense and logic is that common sense presupposes a world common to us all into which we fit and where we can live together because we possess one sense which controls and adjusts all strictly particular sense data to those of all others, whereas logic and all self-evidence from which logical reasoning proceeds can claim a reliability altogether independent from the world and the existence of other people. It has often be observed that the validity of the statement: 2+2 equals 4 is independent of the human condition, it is equall¿ valid for God and man. In other words, wherever common sense fails ▸| us in our need for understanding, we are all too likely to accept logicality as its substitute, because the capacity of logical reasoning itself is common to us all. But this common human capacity which functions even under condition of complete separation from world and experience and which is strictly “within” us, without any bond to something “given, is unable to understand anything and left to itself utterly sterile. Only under conditions where the common realm between men is destroyed and the only reliability left consists in the meaningless tautologies of the self-evident, can this capacity become “productive”, develop its own lines of thought whose chief political characteristic is that it always carries with it a compulsory power of persuasion. To equate thought and understanding with these logical operations means to level down the capacity for thought, which for thousands of years has been deemed to be the highest capacity of man, to its lowest common denominator where no differences of actual existence count any longer, not even the qualitative difference between the essence of God and men.
▸
  What is frightening in the rise of totalitarianism to the quest for meaning and the need for understanding is not that this is something new, but that this has exploded our categories of thought and our standards of judgment. Newness is the realm of the historian who, in distinction from the natural scientist who is concerned with ever recurring happenings, deals with events which always occur only once. This newness can be manipulated if the historian insists on causality and pretends to be able to explain events by a chain of causes which eventually led up to it. He then, indeed, poses as the “prophet turned backward” and all that separates him from the gifts of real prophecy seems to be the deplorable physical limitations of the human brain that unfortunately can contain and combine correctly all causes operating at the same time. Causality, however, is an altogether alien and falsifying category in the realm of the historical sciences. Not only does the actual meaning of every event always transcend any number of past “causes” which we may assign to it (one has only to think of the grotesque disparity between “cause” and effect” in an event such as the first World War), this past itself comes into being only with the event itself; only when something irrevocably has happened can we even try to trace its history backward. The event illuminates its own past, it can never be deduced from it.
  Whoever in the historical sciences believes in causality in true earnest, denies actually the subject matter of his own science. Within the framework of causality, events in the sense of something irrevocably new can never happen; history without events would be the dead monotony of sameness, unfolded in time.
▸
  Whenever an event occurs that is great enough to illuminate its own past, historiy comes into being. Only then does the chaotic maze of past happenings emerge as a story which can be told, which has a beginning and an end. (Herodotus is not merely the first historiographer; “history exists since Herodotus”—in the words of Karl Reinhard, “Herodots Persergeschichten” in Von Werken und Formen, 1948—, that is, the Greek past became history through the light shed on it by the Persian wars.) What the illuminating event reveals is a beginning in the past which hitherto had been hidden; to the eye of the historian, the illuminating event cannot but appear as an end of this newly discovered beginning. Only when in future history a new event occurs will this “end” reveal itself as beginning to the eye of future historians. And the eye of the historian is only the scientifically trained gaze of human understanding; we can understand an event only as the end and the culmination of everything that happened before, as “fulfillment of the times”; only in action will we proceed, as a matter of course, from the changed set of circumstances that the event has created, that is, treat it as a beginning.
  Whoever in the historical sciences believes in causality in true earnest, denies actually the subject matter of his own science. Such a belief can be concealed in the application of general categories to the whole course of happenings, such as challenge and response, or in the search for general trends which supposedly are the “deeper” stratum from which events spring and whose accessory symptoms they are. Such generalizations and categorizations extinguish the “natural” light history itself offers and, by the same token, destroy the actual story, its unique distinction and its eternal meaning, that each historical period has to tell us. Within the framework of preconceived categories, whose crudest is causality, events in the sense of something irrevocably new can never happen; history without events becomes the dead monotony of sameness, unfolded in time,—Lucretius’ Eadem sunt omnia semper .
▸
  Just as in our personal lives our worst fears and our most passionate hopes will never adequately prepare us for what actually happens, because the moment even a foreseen event takes place, everything changes and we can never be prepared for the inexhaustible literalness of this “everything”, so each event in human history reveals an unexpected landscape of human deeds, sufferings and new possibilities which together transcend the sum total of all willed intentions and the significance of all origins. It is the task of the historian to detect this unexpected new with all its implications in any given period and to bring out the full power of its significance. He must know that though his story has a beginning and an end, but the history of man is a story with many beginnings and no end. The end, in any strict and final sense of the word, could only be the disappearance of man from the earth. For whatever the historian calls an end, the end of a period or a tradition or a whole civilization, is a new beginning for those who are alive. The fallacy of all prophecies of doom lies in the disregard of the this simple, but elementary fact.
  To remain aware of this fact will be for the historian of no greater importance than to check what one might call the mental diseases inherent in his profession. Since he is concerned with the past, that is with certain movements which could not even be grasped by the mind if they had not come to some kind of an end, he has only to generalize in order to see end (and doom) everywhere. It is only natural to him to see in history a story with many ends and no beginning; and this inclination becomes really dangerous only when—for whatever reasons—people begin to make a philosophy out of history as it presents itself to the professional eyes of the historian. Nearly all modern explications of the so-called “historicality” of man have been distorted by categories which, at best, are working hypotheses for the arranging of the material of the past.
  Fortunately, the situation of the political sciences which in the highest sense are called upon to pursue the quest for ▸| meaning and to answer the need for true understanding of political data, is quite different. The great consequence which the concept of beginning and origin has for all strictly political questions comes from the simple fact that political action, like all action, is essentially always the beginning of something new; as such, it is, in terms of political science, the very essence of human freedom. The central position which the concept of beginning and origin must have in all political thought has been lost only since the historical sciences have been permitted to supply their methods and categories to the field of politics. It was indicated, as a matter of course, for Greek thought in the fact that the Greek word Arche means both: beginning and rule, and it is still fully alive, though generally overlooked by modern interpreters, in Machiavelli’s theory of political power according to which the act of foundation itself, that is the conscious beginning of something new, requires and justifies the use of violence. In its full significance, however, this was discovered by the one great thinker who lived in a period who resembled in some respects more our own than any other of recorded history and who, in any case, wrote under the full impact of a catastrophic end, which perhaps resembles the end to which we have come. Augustine, in his Civitas Dei (book XII, ch. XX) said: Initium ergo ut esset, creatus est homo, ante quem nullus fuit. (That there might be a beginning, man was created before whom nobody was.) Here, man has not only the capacity of beginning, but is this beginning himself. If the creation of man coincides with the creation of a beginning in the universe (and what else does this mean but the creation of freedom?), then the birth of of all individual men, being new beginnings, re-affirm the origin-al character of man in such a way, that origin can never become entirely a thing of the past; while, on the other hadn, the very fact of the memorable continuity of these beginnings in the sequence of generations guarantees a history which can never end because it is the history of a being whose essence is beginning.
▸
  In the light of these reflections, our enterprise to understand something which has exploded our categories of thought and our standards of judgment appears less frightening. Even though we have lost our yardsticks by which to measure and our rules under which to subsume the particular, a being whose essence is beginning may have enough of origin within himself to understand without preconceived categories and to judge without without the set of customary rules which is morality. If the essence of all, and also of political action is to make a new beginning, then understanding in this sense would only be the other side of action, namely that form of cognition, in distinction to many others, by which acting men (and not men who are engaged to contemplate some progressive or doomed course of history) eventually can come to terms with what irrevocably happened and get reconciled with what unavoidably exists.
  As such, understanding is a strange enterprise. In the end, it may do no more than articulate and confirm what preliminary understanding, which always consciously or unconsciously is directly engaged in action, knew to begin with. It will not shy away from this circle but on the contrary be aware that any other results would be so far removed from action, of which it is only the other side, that they cannot possibly be true. Nor will it in the process itself avoid the circle which the logicians use to call “vicious” and may in this respect even resemble a little philosophy whose great thought always turn around in circles, engaging the human mind in nothing less than that interminable dialogue between itself and the essence of everything that is.
  In this sense, the old prayer which King Solomon, who certainly knew something of political action, addressed to God for the gift of an “understanding heart” as one of the greatest gift a man could receive and desire, might still be true. As far removed from sentimentality as it is from paperwork, the human heart is the only thing in the world that will take upon itself the burden which the divine gift of action, of being a beginning and therefore being able to make a beginning, has placed upon us. Solomon, because he was a King, prayed for this particular gift because he knew that only an “understanding heart”, and neither ▸| mere reflection nor mere feeling, makes it bearable for us to live with other people, strangers for ever, in the same world and makes it possible for them to bear with us.
  If we wish to translate the Biblical language into terms that are closer (though hardly more accurate) to our speech, we may call the gift of an “understandin heart” the faculty of imagination, in distinction from phantasy which dreams up something, imagination is concerned with the particular darkness of the human heart and the peculiar density which surrounds everything that is real. Whenever we talk of the “nature” or the “essence” of a thing, we actually mean this innermost kernel of whose existence we can never be as sure as we are of darkness and density. True understanding does not tire of the interminable dialogue and the “vicious circles”, because it trusts that understanding eventually will catch at least a glimpse of the always frightening light of truth.
  Only imagination is capable of “putting things into their proper distance”; by this, we actually mean that we should be strong enough to remove that which is too close until we can see and understand it without bias and prejudice, and that we should be generous enough to bridge abysses of remoteness until we can see and understand everything that is too far away from us as though it were our own affair. This removing some things and bridging the abysses to others is already part of the dialogue of understanding for whose purposes direct experience establishes too close a contact and mere knowledge erects artificial barriers.
  Without this kind of imagination, which actually is understanding, we never would be able to take our bearings in the world. It is the only inner compass we have. Contemporaries we are only so far as our understanding reaches. If we want to be at home on this earth, even at the price of being at home in this century, we shall have to try at least the interminable dialogue with its nature.
